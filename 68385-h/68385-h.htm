</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> book has been an adventure in intellectual co-operation.
If it were a mere collection of haphazard essays, gathered
together to make the conventional symposium, it would have
only slight significance. But it has been the deliberate and
organized outgrowth of the common efforts of like-minded men
and women to see the problem of modern American civilization
as a whole, and to illuminate by careful criticism the
special aspect of that civilization with which the individual
is most familiar. Personal contact has served to correct overemphasis,
and slow and careful selection of the members of a
group which has now grown to some thirty-odd has given to
this work a unity of approach and attack which it otherwise
could not possibly have had.</p>

<p>The nucleus of this group was brought together by common
work, common interests, and more or less common assumptions.
As long ago as the autumn of last year Mr. Van Wyck
Brooks and I discussed the possibility of several of us,
who were engaged in much the same kind of critical examination
of our civilization, coming together to exchange ideas, to
clarify our individual fields, and to discover wherein they coincided,
overlapped, or diverged. The original desire was the
modest one of making it possible for us to avoid working at
cross-purposes. I suggested that we meet at my home, which
a few of us did, and since that time until the delivery of this
volume to the publishers we have met every fortnight. Even
at our first meeting we discovered our points of view to have
so much in common that our desire for informal and pleasant
discussions became the more serious wish to contribute a definite
and tangible piece of work towards the advance of intellectual
life in America. We wished to speak the truth about
American civilization as we saw it, in order to do our share
in making a real civilization possible—for I think with all of
us there was a common assumption that a field cannot be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
ploughed until it has first been cleared of rocks, and that constructive
criticism can hardly exist until there is something
on which to construct.</p>

<p>Naturally the first problem to arise was the one of ways and
means. If the spirit and temper of the French encyclopædists
of the 18th century appealed strongly to us, certainly their
method for the advancement of knowledge was inapplicable in
our own century. The cultural phenomena we proposed to
survey were too complicated and extensive; besides, we wished
to make a definite contribution of some kind or another while,
so to speak, there was yet time. For the cohesiveness of the
group, the good-humoured tolerance and cheerful sacrifice of
time, were to some extent the consequence of the intellectual
collapse that came with the hysterical post-armistice days,
when it was easier than in normal times to get together intelligent
and civilized men and women in common defence against
the common enemy of reaction. We wished to take advantage
of this strategic situation for the furtherance of our co-operative
enterprise, and decided, finally, that the simplest plan
would be the best. Each of us was to write a single short
essay on the special topic we knew most thoroughly; we were
to continue our meetings in order to keep informed of the
progress of our work and to see that there was no duplication;
we were to extend the list of subjects to whatever legitimately
bore upon our cultural life and to select the authors by common
agreement; we were to keep in touch with each other
so that the volume might have that inner consistency which
could come only from direct acquaintance with what each of
us was planning.</p>

<p>There were a few other simple rules which we laid down
in the beginning. Desirous of avoiding merely irrelevant criticism
and of keeping attention upon our actual treatment of
our subjects rather than upon our personalities, we provided
that all contributors to the volume must be American citizens.
For the same reason, we likewise provided that in the list there
should be no professional propagandists—except as one is a
propagandist for one’s own ideas—no martyrs, and no one who
was merely disgruntled. Since our object was to give an uncompromising,
and consequently at some points necessarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">v</span>
harsh, analysis, we desired the tone to be good-natured and
the temper urbane. At first, these larger points of policy were
decided by common agreement or, on occasion, by majority
vote, and to the end I settled no important question without
consultation with as many members of the group as I could
approach within the limited time we had agreed to have this
volume in the hands of the publisher. But with the extension
of the scope of the book, the negotiations with the publisher,
and the mass of complexities and details that are inevitable in
so difficult an enterprise, the authority to decide specific questions
and the usual editorial powers were delegated as a matter
of convenience to me, aided by a committee of three. Hence
I was in a position constantly to see the book as a whole,
and to make suggestions for differentiation, where repetition
appeared to impend, or for unity, where the divergence
was sharp enough to be construed by some as contradictory.
In view both of the fact that every contributor has full liberty
of opinion and that the personalities and points of view finding
expression in the essays are all highly individualistic, the underlying
unity which binds the volume together is really
surprising.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that a volume on civilization in the
United States does not include a specific article on religion,
and the omission is worth a paragraph of explanation. Outside
the bigger cities, certainly no one can understand the social
structure of contemporary American life without careful study
of the organization and power of the church. Speaking generally,
we are a church-going people, and at least on the surface
the multiplicity of sects and creeds, the sheer immensity
of the physical apparatus by which the religious impulse is
articulated, would seem to prove that our interest in and
emotional craving for religious experience are enormous. But
the omission has not been due to any superciliousness on our
part towards the subject itself; on the contrary, I suppose I
have put more thought and energy into this essay, which has
not been written, than into any other problem connected with
the book. The bald truth is, it has been next to impossible
to get any one to write on the subject; most of the people I
approached shied off—it was really difficult to get them to talk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
about it at all. Almost unanimously, when I did manage to
procure an opinion from them, they said that real religious
feeling in America had disappeared, that the church had become
a purely social and political institution, that the country
is in the grip of what Anatole France has aptly called Protestant
clericalism, and that, finally, they weren’t interested in
the topic. The accuracy of these observations (except the
last) I cannot, of course, vouch for, but it is rather striking
that they were identical. In any event, the topic as a topic
has had to be omitted; but it is not neglected, for in several
essays directly—in particular, “Philosophy” and “Nerves”—and
in many by implication the subject is discussed. At one
time Mr. James Harvey Robinson consented to write the article—and
it would have been an illuminating piece of work—but
unfortunately ill health and the pressure of official duties made
the task impossible for him within the most generous time
limit that might be arranged.</p>

<p>I have spoken already of the unity which underlies the volume.
When I remember all these essays, and try to summon
together the chief themes that run through them, either by
explicit statement or as a kind of underlying rhythm to all,
in order to justify the strong impression of unity, I find three
major contentions that may be said to be basic—contentions
all the more significant inasmuch as they were unpremeditated
and were arrived at, as it were, by accident rather than design.
They are:</p>

<p>First, That in almost every branch of American life there
is a sharp dichotomy between preaching and practice; we let
not our right hand know what our left hand doeth. Curiously
enough, no one regards this, and in fact no one consciously
feels this as hypocrisy—there are certain abstractions and
dogmas which are sacred to us, and if we fall short of these
external standards in our private life, that is no reason for
submitting them to a fresh examination; rather are we to
worship them the more vociferously to show our sense of sin.
Regardless, then, of the theoretical excellence or stupidity of
these standards, in actual practice the moral code resolves itself
into the one cardinal heresy of being found out, with the chief
sanction enforcing it, the fear of what people will say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span></p>

<p>Second, That whatever else American civilization is, it is not
Anglo-Saxon, and that we shall never achieve any genuine
nationalistic self-consciousness as long as we allow certain
financial and social minorities to persuade us that we are still
an English Colony. Until we begin seriously to appraise and
warmly to cherish the heterogeneous elements which make up
our life, and to see the common element running through all
of them, we shall make not even a step towards true unity;
we shall remain, in Roosevelt’s class-conscious and bitter but
illuminating phrase, a polyglot boarding-house. It is curious
how a book on American civilization actually leads one back
to the conviction that we are, after all, Americans.</p>

<p>Third, That the most moving and pathetic fact in the social
life of America to-day is emotional and æsthetic starvation,
of which the mania for petty regulation, the driving, regimentating,
and drilling, the secret society and its grotesque regalia,
the firm grasp on the unessentials of material organization of
our pleasures and gaieties are all eloquent stigmata. We have
no heritages or traditions to which to cling except those that
have already withered in our hands and turned to dust. One
can feel the whole industrial and economic situation as so
maladjusted to the primary and simple needs of men and
women that the futility of a rationalistic attack on these infantilisms
of compensation becomes obvious. There must be
an entirely new deal of the cards in one sense; we must change
our hearts. For only so, unless through the humbling of
calamity or scourge, can true art and true religion and true
personality, with their native warmth and caprice and gaiety,
grow up in America to exorcise these painted devils we have
created to frighten us away from the acknowledgment of our
spiritual poverty.</p>

<p>If these main contentions seem severe or pessimistic, the
answer must be: we do not write to please; we strive only
to understand and to state as clearly as we can. For American
civilization is still in the embryonic stage, with rich and
with disastrous possibilities of growth. But the first step in
growing up is self-conscious and deliberately critical examination
of ourselves, without sentimentality and without fear. We
cannot even devise, much less control, the principles which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
to guide our future development until that preliminary understanding
has come home with telling force to the consciousness
of the ordinary man. To this self-understanding, this book is,
in our belief, a genuine and valuable contribution. We may
not always have been wise; we have tried always to be honest.
And if our attempt will help to embolden others to an equally
frank expression of their beliefs, perhaps in time wisdom will
come.</p>

<p>I am glad that, however serious, we are never solemn in these
essays. Often, in fact, we are quite gay, and it would be a
humourless person indeed who could not read many of them,
even when the thrusts are at himself, with that laughter which
Rabelais tells us is proper to the man. For whatever our defects,
we Americans, we have one virtue and perhaps a saving
virtue—we still know how to laugh at ourselves.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Around</span> us, in the city, each epoch in America has been
concentrated and crystallized. In building our cities we
deflowered a wilderness. To-day more than one-half the population
of the United States lives in an environment which
the jerry-builder, the real estate speculator, the paving contractor,
and the industrialist have largely created. Have we
begotten a civilization? That is a question which a survey of
the American city will help us to answer.</p>

<p>If American history is viewed from the standpoint of the
student of cities, it divides itself roughly into three parts. The
first was a provincial period, which lasted from the foundation
of Manhattan down to the opening up of ocean commerce after
the War of 1812. This was followed by a commercial period,
which began with the cutting of canals and ended with the
extension of the railroad system across the continent, and an
industrial period, that gathered force on the Atlantic seaboard
in the ’thirties and is still the dominant economic phase of
our civilization. These periods must not be looked upon as
strictly successive or exclusive: the names merely express in a
crude way the main aspect of each era. It is possible to
telescope the story of America’s colonial expansion and industrial
exploitation by following the material growth and the
cultural impoverishment of the American city during its transformations.</p>

<p>The momentum of the provincial city lasted well on to the
Civil War. The economic basis of this period was agriculture
and petty trade: its civic expression was, typically, the small
New England town, with a central common around which were
grouped a church—appropriately called a meeting-house—a
school, and perhaps a town hall. Its main street would be
lined with tall suave elms and bordered by reticent white
houses of much the same design as those that dotted the countryside.
In the growing towns of the seaboard this culture was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
overthrown, before it had a chance to express itself adequately
in either institutions or men, and it bloomed rather tardily,
therefore, in the little towns of Concord and Cambridge, between
1820 and the Civil War. We know it to-day through
a largely anonymous architecture, and through a literature created
by the school of writers that bears the name of the chief
city. Unfortunately for the further development of what we
might call the Concord culture, the agricultural basis of this
civilization shifted to the wheat-growing West; and therewith
channels of trade were diverted from Boston to ports that
tapped a richer, more imperial hinterland. What remained
of the provincial town in New England was a mummy-case.</p>

<p>The civilization of the New England town spent itself in
the settlement of the Ohio Valley and the great tracts beyond.
None of the new centres had, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">qua</i> provincial towns, any fresh
contribution to make. It had taken the culture of New England
more than three centuries before it had borne its Concord
fruit, and the story of the Western movement is somehow
summed up in the legend of Johnny Appleseed, who
planted dry apple seeds, instead of slips from the living tree,
and hedged the roads he travelled with wild apples, harsh and
puny and inedible. Cincinnati and Pittsburgh jumped from
a frustrate provincialism into the midst of the machine era;
and so for a long time they remained destitute of the institutions
that are necessary to carry on the processes of civilization.</p>

<p>West of the Alleghanies, the common, with its church and
school, was not destined to dominate the urban landscape: the
railroad station and the commercial hotel had come to take
their place. This was indeed the universal mark of the new
industrialism, as obvious in 19th-century Oxford as in Hoboken.
The pioneer American city, however, had none of the
cultural institutions that had been accumulated in Europe during
the great outbursts of the Middle Age and the Renaissance,
and as a result its destitution was naked and apparent. It is
true that every town which was developed mainly during the
19th century—Manchester as well as Milwaukee—suffered
from the absence of civic institutes. The peculiarity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
New World was that the facilities for borrowing from the
older centres were considerably more limited. London could
export Madox Brown to Manchester to do the murals in the
Town Hall: New York had still to create its schools of art
before it had any Madox Browns that could be exported.</p>

<p>With the beginning of the 19th century, market centres which
had at first tapped only their immediate region began to reach
further back into the hinterland, and to stretch outward, not
merely for freight but for immigrants, across the ocean. The
silly game of counting heads became the fashion, and in the
literature of the ’thirties one discovers that every commercial
city had its statistical lawyer who was bold enough to predict
its leadership in “population and wealth” before the century
was out. The chief boast of the American city was its prospective
size.</p>

<p>Now the New England town was a genuine community. In
so far as the New England community had a common social
and political and religious life, the town expressed it. The
city which was representative of the second period, on the
other hand, was in origin a trading fort, and the supreme
occupation of its founders was with the goods life rather than
the good life. New York, Pittsburgh, Chicago, and St. Louis
have this common basis. They were not composed of corporate
organizations on the march, as it were, towards a New
Jerusalem: they were simply a rabble of individuals “on the
make.” With such a tradition to give it momentum it is
small wonder that the adventurousness of the commercial period
was exhausted on the fortuities and temptations of trade. A
state of intellectual anæsthesia prevailed. One has only to
compare Cist’s <cite>Cincinnati Miscellany</cite> with Emerson’s <cite>Dial</cite> to
see at what a low level the towns of the Middle West were
carrying on.</p>

<p>Since there was neither fellowship nor social stability nor
security in the scramble of the inchoate commercial city, it
remained for a particular institution to devote itself to the
gospel of the “glad hand.” Thus an historian of Pittsburgh
records the foundation of a Masonic lodge as early as 1785,
shortly after the building of the church, and in every American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
city, small or big, Odd Fellows, Mystic Shriners, Woodmen,
Elks, Knights of Columbus, and other orders without
number in the course of time found for themselves a prominent
place. (Their feminine counterparts were the D.A.R.
and the W.C.T.U., their juniors, the college Greek letter fraternities.)
Whereas one will search American cities in vain
for the labour temples one discovers to-day in Europe from
Belgium to Italy, one finds that the fraternal lodge generally
occupies a site of dignity and importance. There were doubtless
many excellent reasons for the strange proliferation of
professional fraternity in the American city, but perhaps the
strongest reason was the absence of any other kind of fraternity.
The social centre and the community centre, which
in a singularly hard and consciously beatific way have sought
to organize fellowship and mutual aid on different terms, are
products of the last decade.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only other civic institution of importance that
the commercial towns fostered was the lyceum: forerunner
of the elephantine Chautauqua. The lyceum lecture, however,
was taken as a soporific rather than a stimulant, and if it
aroused any appetite for art, philosophy, or science there was
nothing in the environment of the commercial city that could
satisfy it. Just as church-going became a substitute for religion,
so automatic lyceum attendance became a substitute for
thought. These were the prayer wheels of a preoccupied
commercialism.</p>

<p>The contrast between the provincial and the commercial
city in America was well summed up in their plans. Consider
the differences between Cambridge and New York. Up to the
beginning of the 19th century New York, at the tip of Manhattan
Island, had the same diffident, rambling town plan that
characterizes Cambridge. In this old type of city layout the
streets lead nowhere, except to the buildings that give onto
them: outside the main roads the provisions for traffic are so
inadequate as to seem almost a provision against traffic. Quiet
streets, a pleasant aspect, ample domestic facilities were the
desiderata of the provincial town; traffic, realty speculation,
and expansion were those of the newer era. This became evident
as soon as the Empire City started to realize its “manifest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
destiny” by laying down, in 1808, a plan for its future
development.</p>

<p>New York’s city plan commissioners went about their work
with a scarcely concealed purpose to increase traffic and raise
realty values. The amenities of city life counted for little in
their scheme of things: debating “whether they should confine
themselves to rectilinear and rectangular streets, or
whether they should adopt some of those supposed improvements,
by circles, ovals, and stars,” they decided, on grounds
of economy, against any departure from the gridiron design.
It was under the same stimulus that these admirable philistines
had the complacency to plan the city’s development up to
155th Street. Here we are concerned, however, with the
results of the rectangular plan rather than with the
motives that lay behind its adoption throughout the country.</p>

<p>The principal effect of the gridiron plan is that every street
becomes a thoroughfare, and that every thoroughfare is potentially
a commercial street. The tendency towards movement
in such a city vastly outweighs the tendency towards
settlement. As a result of progressive shifts in population,
due to the changes to which commercial competition subjects
the use of land, the main institutions of the city, instead of
cohering naturally—as the museums, galleries, theatres, clubs,
and public offices group themselves in the heart of Westminster—are
dispersed in every direction. Neither Columbia
University, New York University, the Astor Library, nor the
National Academy of Design—to seize but a few examples—is
on its original site. Yet had Columbia remained at Fiftieth
Street it might have had some effective working relation with
the great storehouse of books that now occupies part of
Bryant Park at Forty-second Street; or, alternatively, had the
Astor Library remained on its old site it might have had some
connection with New York University—had that institution not
in turn moved!</p>

<p>What was called the growth of the commercial city was
really a manifestation of the absence of design in the gridiron
plan. The rectangular parcelling of ground promoted speculation
in land-units and the ready interchange of real property:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
it had no relation whatever to the essential purposes for
which a city exists. It is not a little significant that Chicago,
Cincinnati, and St. Louis, each of which had space set aside
for public purposes in their original plans, had given up these
civic holdings to the realty gambler before half of the 19th
century was over. The common was not the centre of a
well-rounded community life, as in New England, but the centre
of land-speculation—which was at once the business, the
recreation, and the religion of the commercial city. Under
the influence of New York the Scadders whom Martin Chuzzlewit
encountered were laying down their New Edens throughout
the country.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>It was during the commercial period that the evolution of
the Promenade, such as existed in New York at Battery
Park, took place. The new promenade was no longer a park
but a shop-lined thoroughfare, Broadway. Shopping became
for the more domesticated half of the community an exciting,
bewildering amusement; and out of a combination of Yankee
“notions,” Barnum-like advertisement, and magisterial organization
arose that <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">omnium gatherum</i> of commerce, the
department store. It is scarcely possible to exaggerate the
part that Broadway—I use the term generically—has played
in the American town. It is not merely the Agora but the
Acropolis. When the factory whistle closes the week, and
the factory hands of Camden, or Pittsburgh, or Bridgeport pour
out of the buildings and stockades in which they spend the
more exhausting half of their lives, it is through Broadway
that the greater part of their repressions seek an outlet. Both
the name and the institution extend across the continent from
New York to Los Angeles. Up and down these second-hand
Broadways, from one in the afternoon until past ten at night,
drifts a more or less aimless mass of human beings, bent upon
extracting such joy as is possible from the sights in the windows,
the contacts with other human beings, the occasional or
systematic flirtations, and the risks and adventures of purchase.</p>

<p>In the early development of Broadway the amusements were
adventitious. Even at present, in spite of the ubiquitous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
movie, the crowded street itself, at least in the smaller communities,
is the main source of entertainment. Now, under
normal conditions, for a great part of the population in a
factory town one of the chief instincts to be repressed is that
of acquisition (collection). It is not merely that the average
factory worker cannot afford the luxuries of life: the worst
is that he must think twice before purchasing the necessities.
Out of this situation one of Broadway’s happiest achievements
has arisen: the five and ten cent store. In the five and ten
cent store it is possible for the circumscribed factory operative
to obtain the illusion of unmoderated expenditure—and even
extravagance—without actually inflicting any irreparable rent
in his purse. Broadway is thus, in more than one sense, the
great compensatory device of the American city. The dazzle
of white lights, the colour of electric signs, the alabaster architecture
of the moving-picture palaces, the æsthetic appeals of
the shop windows—these stand for elements that are left out
of the drab perspectives of the industrial city. People who
do not know how to spend their time must take what satisfaction
they can in spending their money. That is why, although
the five and ten cent store itself is perhaps mainly an institution
for the proletariat, the habits and dispositions it encourages
are universal. The chief amusement of Atlantic City, that
opulent hostelry-annex of New York and Philadelphia, lies
not in the beach and the ocean but in the shops which line the
interminable Broadway known as the Boardwalk.</p>

<p>Broadway, in sum, is the façade of the American city: a
false front. The highest achievements of our material civilization—and
at their best our hotels, our department stores, and
our Woolworth towers are achievements—count as so many
symptoms of its spiritual failure. In order to cover up the
vacancy of getting and spending in our cities, we have invented
a thousand fresh devices for getting and spending. As a consequence
our life is externalized. The principal institutions
of the American city are merely distractions that take our eyes
off the environment, instead of instruments which would help
us to mould it creatively a little nearer to humane hopes and
desires.</p>

<p>The birth of industrialism in America is announced in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
opening of the Crystal Palace in Bryant Park, Manhattan, in
1853. Between the Crystal Palace Exhibition and the Chicago
World’s Fair in 1893 lies a period whose defects were
partly accentuated by the exhaustion that followed the Civil
War. The debasement of the American city during this period
can be read in almost every building that was erected. The
influence of colonial architecture had waned to extinction during
the first half of the century. There followed a period of
eclectic experiment, in which all sorts of Egyptian, Byzantine,
Gothic, and Arabesque ineptitudes were committed—a period
whose absurdities we have only in recent years begun to escape.
The domestic style, as the century progressed, became
more limited. Little touches about the doors, mouldings, fanlights,
and balustrades disappeared, and finally craftsmanship
went out of style altogether and a pretentious architectural
puffery took its place. The “era of good feeling” was an era
of bad taste.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh, St. Louis, and Chicago give perhaps the most
naked revelation of the industrial city’s characteristics.
There were two institutions that set their mark upon the early
part of this period. One of them was the Mechanics’ Hall.
This was usually a building of red brick, structural iron, and
glass, whose unique hideousness marks it as a typical product
of the age of coal-industrialism, to be put alongside the
“smoke-halls” of the railroad termini. The other institution
was the German beer-garden—the one bright spot on the edge
of an urban landscape that was steadily becoming more dingy,
more dull, and more depressing. The cities that came to life
in this period had scarcely any other civic apparatus to boast
of. Conceive of Pittsburgh without Schenley Park, without
the Carnegie Institute, without the Library or the Museum
or the Concert Hall, and without the institutions that have
grown up during the last generation around its sub-Acropolis—and
one has a picture of Progress and Poverty that Henry
George might have drawn on for illustration. The industrial
city did not represent the creative values in civilization: it
stood for a new form of human barbarism. In the coal towns
of Pennsylvania, the steel towns of the Ohio and its tributaries,
and the factory towns of Long Island Sound and Narragansett<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
Bay was an environment much more harsh, antagonistic,
and brutal than anything the pioneers had encountered.
Even the fake exhilaration of the commercial city was lacking.</p>

<p>The reaction against the industrial city was expressed in
various ways. The defect of these reactions was that they
were formulated in terms of an escape from the environment
rather than in a reconstruction of it. Symptomatic of this
escape, along one particular alley, was the architecture of
Richardson, and of his apprentices, McKim and White. No
one who has an eye for the fine incidence of beautiful architecture
can avoid a shock at discovering a monumental Romanesque
building at the foot of Pittsburgh’s dingy “Hump,”
or the hardly less monstrous beauty of Trinity Church, Boston,
as one approaches it from a waste of railroad yards that
lie on one side of it. It was no accident, one is inclined to
believe, that Richardson should have returned to the Romanesque
only a little time before Henry Adams was exploring
Mont St. Michel and Chartres. Both men were searching
for a specific against the fever of industrialism, and architects
like Richardson were taking to archaic beauty as a man
who was vaguely ill might have recourse to quinine, in the
hope that his disease had sufficient similarity to malaria to be
cured by it.</p>

<p>The truth is that the doses of exotic architecture which
Richardson and his school sought to inject into the American
city were anodynes rather than specifics. The Latin Renaissance
models of McKim and White—the Boston Public Library
and Madison Square Garden, for example—were perhaps
a little better suited to the concrete demands of the new
age; but they were still a long way from that perfect congruence
with contemporary habits and modes of thought which
was recorded in buildings like Independence Hall. Almost
down to the last decade the best buildings of the industrial
period have been anonymous, and scarcely ever recognized for
their beauty. A grain elevator here, a warehouse there, an
office building, a garage—there has been the promise of a
stripped, athletic, classical style of architecture in these buildings
which shall embody all that is good in the Machine Age:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
its precision, its cleanliness, its hard illuminations, its unflinching
logic. Dickens once poked fun at the architecture of
Coketown because its infirmary looked like its jail and its jail
like its town hall. But the joke had a sting to it only because
these buildings were all plaintively destitute of æsthetic inspiration.
In a place and an age that had achieved a well-rounded
and balanced culture, we should expect to find the same spirit
expressed in the simplest cottage and the grandest public
building. So we find it, for instance, in the humble market
towns of the Middle Age: there is not one type of architecture
for 15th-century Shaftesbury and another for London; neither
is there one style for public London and quite another for
domestic London. Our architects in America have only just
begun to cease regarding the Gothic style as especially fit for
churches and schools, whilst they favour the Roman mode
for courts, and the Byzantine, perhaps, for offices. Even the
unique beauty of the Bush Terminal Tower is compromised by
an antiquely “stylized” interior.</p>

<p>With the beginning of the second decade of this century
there is some evidence of an attempt to make a genuine culture
out of industrialism—instead of attempting to escape from
industrialism into a culture which, though doubtless genuine
enough, has the misfortune to be dead. The schoolhouses
in Gary, Indiana, have some of the better qualities of a Gary
steel plant. That symptom is all to the good. It points perhaps
to a time when the Gary steel plant may have some of
the educational virtues of a Gary school. One of the things
that has made the industrial age a horror in America is the
notion that there is something shameful in its manifestations.
The idea that nobody would ever go near an industrial plant
except under stress of starvation is in part responsible for the
heaps of rubbish and rusty metal, for the general disorder
and vileness, that still characterize broad acres of our factory
districts. There is nothing short of the Alkali Desert that
compares with the desolateness of the common American industrial
town. These qualities are indicative of the fact that
we have centred attention not upon the process but upon the
return; not upon the task but the emoluments: not upon what
we can get out of our work but upon what we can achieve when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
we get away from our work. Our industrialism has been in
the grip of business, and our industrial cities, and their institutions,
have exhibited a major preoccupation with business.
The coercive repression of an impersonal, mechanical technique
was compensated by the pervasive will-to-power—or
at least will-to-comfort—of commercialism.</p>

<p>We have shirked the problem of trying to live well in a
régime that is devoted to the production of T-beams and toothbrushes
and TNT. As a result, we have failed to react creatively
upon the environment with anything like the inspiration
that one might have found in a group of mediæval peasants
building a cathedral. The urban worker escapes the mechanical
routine of his daily job only to find an equally mechanical
substitute for life and growth and experience in his amusements.
The Gay White Way with its stupendous blaze of
lights, and Coney Island, with its fear-stimulating roller coasters
and chute-the-chutes, are characteristic by-products of an
age that has renounced the task of actively humanizing the
machine, and of creating an environment in which all the fruitful
impulses of the community may be expressed. The movies,
the White Ways, and the Coney Islands, which almost every
American city boasts in some form or other, are means of
giving jaded and throttled people the sensations of living
without the direct experience of life—a sort of spiritual masturbation.
In short, we have had the alternative of humanizing
the industrial city or de-humanizing the population. So far
we have de-humanized the population.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The external reactions against the industrial city came to a
head in the World’s Fair at Chicago. In that strange and
giddy mixture of Parnassus and Coney Island was born a new
conception of the city—a White City, spaciously designed,
lighted by electricity, replete with monuments, crowned with
public buildings, and dignified by a radiant architecture. The
men who planned the exposition knew something about the
better side of the spacious perspectives that Haussmann had
designed for Napoleon III. Without taking into account the
fundamental conditions of industrialism, or the salient facts
of economics, they initiated what shortly came to be known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
as the City Beautiful movement. For a couple of decades
Municipal Art societies were rampant. Their programme had
the defects of the régime it attempted to combat. Its capital
effort was to put on a front—to embellish Main Street and
make it a more attractive thoroughfare. Here in æsthetics,
as elsewhere in education, persisted the brahminical view of
culture: the idea that beauty was something that could be
acquired by any one who was willing to put up the cash; that
it did not arise naturally out of the good life but was something
which could be plastered on impoverished life; in short,
that it was a cosmetic.</p>

<p>Until the Pittsburgh Survey of 1908 pricked a pin through
superficial attempts at municipal improvement, those who
sought to remake the American city overlooked the necessity
for rectifying its economic basis. The meanness, the spotty
development, and the congestion of the American city was at
least in some degree an index of that deep disease of realty
speculation which had, as already noted, caused cities like
Chicago to forfeit land originally laid aside for public uses.
Because facts like these were ignored for the sake of some
small, immediate result, the developments that the early reformers
were bold enough to outline still lie in the realms of
hopeless fantasy—a fine play of the imagination, like Scadder’s
prospectus of Eden. Here as elsewhere there have been
numerous signs of promise during the last decade; but it is
doubtful whether they are yet numerous enough or profound
enough to alter the general picture.</p>

<p>At best, the improvements that have been effected in the
American city have not been central but subsidiary. They
have been improvements, as Aristotle would have said, in the
material bases of the good life: they have not been improvements
in the art of living. The growth of the American
city during the past century has meant the extension of paved
streets and sewers and gas mains, and progressive heightening
of office buildings and tenements. The outlay on pavements,
sewers, electric lighting systems, and plumbing has been stupendous;
but no matter what the Rotary Clubs and Chambers
of Commerce may think of them, these mechanical ingenuities
are not the indices of a civilization. There is a curious confusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
in America between growth and improvement. We use
the phrase “bigger and better” as if the conjunction were
inevitable. As a matter of fact, there is little evidence to show
that the vast increase of population in every urban area has
been accompanied by anything like the necessary increase of
schools, universities, theatres, meeting places, parks, and so
forth. The fact that in 1920 we had sixty-four cities with
more than 100,000 population, thirty-three with more than
200,000, and twelve with more than 500,000 does not mean
that the resources of polity, culture, and art have been correspondingly
on the increase. The growth of the American city
has resulted less in the establishment of civilized standards of
life than in the extension of Suburbia.</p>

<p>“Suburbia” is used here in both the accepted and in a more
literal sense. On one hand I refer to the fact that the growth
of the metropolis throws vast numbers of people into distant
dormitories where, by and large, life is carried on without the
discipline of rural occupations and without the cultural resources
that the Central District of the city still retains in its
art exhibitions, theatres, concerts, and the like. But our metropolises
produce Suburbia not merely by reason of the fact
that the people who work in the offices, bureaus, and factories
live as citizens in a distant territory, perhaps in another state:
they likewise foster Suburbia in another sense. I mean that
the quality of life for the great mass of people who live within
the political boundaries of the metropolis itself is inferior to
that which a city with an adequate equipment and a thorough
realization of the creative needs of the community is capable
of producing. In this sense, the “suburb” called Brookline
is a genuine city; while the greater part of the “city of Boston”
is a suburb. We have scarcely begun to make an adequate
distribution of libraries, meeting places, parks, gymnasia,
and similar equipment, without which life in the city tends to
be carried on at a low level of routine—physically as well as
mentally. (The blatantly confidential advertisements of constipation
remedies on all the hoardings tell a significant story.)
At any reasonable allotment of park space, the Committee on
Congestion in New York pointed out in 1911, a greater number
of acres was needed for parks on the lower East Side than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
was occupied by the entire population. This case is extreme
but representative.</p>

<p>It is the peculiarity of our metropolitan civilization, then,
that in spite of vast resources drawn from the ends of the
earth, it has an insufficient civic equipment, and what it does
possess it uses only transiently. Those cities that have the
beginnings of an adequate equipment, like New York—to
choose no more invidious example—offer them chiefly to those
engaged in travelling. As a traveller’s city New York is near
perfection. An association of cigar salesmen or an international
congress of social scientists, meeting in one of the
auditoriums of a big hotel, dining together, mixing in the
lounge, and finding recreation in the theatres hard by, discovers
an environment that is ordered, within its limits, to a nicety. It
is this hotel and theatre district that we must charitably think
of when we are tempted to speak about the triumphs of the
American city. Despite manifold defects that arise from want
of planning, this is the real civic centre of America’s Metropolis.
What we must overlook in this characterization are the long
miles of slum that stretch in front and behind and on each
side of this district—neighbourhoods where, in spite of the
redoubtable efforts of settlement workers, block organizers, and
neighbourhood associations, there is no permanent institution,
other than the public school or the sectarian church, to remind
the inhabitants that they have a common life and a common
destiny.</p>

<p>Civic life, in fine, the life of intelligent association and common
action, a life whose faded pattern still lingers in the old
New England town, is not something that we daily enjoy, as
we work in an office or a factory. It is rather a temporary
state that we occasionally achieve with a great deal of time,
bother, and expense. The city is not around us, in our little
town, suburb, or neighbourhood: it lies beyond us, at the end
of a subway ride or a railway journey. We are citizens occasionally:
we are suburbanites (<em>denizens</em>, <em>idiots</em>) by regular
routine. Small wonder that bathtubs and heating systems and
similar apparatus play such a large part in our conception of
the good life.</p>

<p>Metropolitanism in America represents, from the cultural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
angle, a reaction against the uncouth and barren countryside
that was skinned, rather than cultivated, by the restless, individualistic,
self-assertive American pioneer. The perpetual
drag to New York, and the endeavour of less favourably situated
cities to imitate the virtues and defects of New York,
is explicable as nothing other than the desire to participate
in some measure in the benefits of city life. Since we have
failed up to the present to develop genuine regional cultures,
those who do not wish to remain barbarians must become
metropolitans. That means they must come to New York,
or ape the ways that are fashionable in New York. Here
opens the breach that has begun to widen between the metropolis
and the countryside in America. The countryman,
who cannot enjoy the advantages of the metropolis, who has
no centre of his own to which he can point with pride, resents
the privileges that the metropolitan enjoys. Hence the periodical
crusades of our State Legislatures, largely packed with
rural representatives, against the vices, corruptions, and follies
which the countryman enviously looks upon as the peculiar
property of the big city. Perhaps the envy and resentment
of the farming population is due to a genuine economic grievance
against the big cities—especially against their banks,
insurance companies, and speculative middlemen. Should the
concentration of power, glory, and privilege in the metropolis
continue, it is possible that the city will find itself subject to
an economic siege. If our cities cannot justify their existence
by their creative achievements, by their demonstration of the
efficacy and grace of corporate life, it is doubtful whether they
will be able to persuade the country to support them, once the
purely conventional arrangements by means of which the city
browbeats the countryside are upset. This, however, brings
us to the realm of social speculation; and he who would enter
it must abandon everything but hope.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Metropolitanism is of two orders. At its partial best it is
exhibited in New York, the literal mother city of America.
In its worst aspect it shows itself in the sub-metropolises which
have been spawning so prolifically since the ’eighties. If we
are to understand the capacities and limitations of the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
great cities in America, we must first weigh the significance of
New York.</p>

<p>The forces that have made New York dominant are inherent
in our financial and industrial system; elsewhere those
same forces, working in slightly different ways, created London,
Rome, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Petrograd, and Moscow.
What happened in the industrial towns of America was that
the increments derived from land, capital, and association went,
not to the enrichment of the local community, but to those who
had a legal title to the land and the productive machinery. In
other words, the gains that were made in Pittsburgh, Springfield,
Dayton, and a score of other towns that became important
in the industrial era were realized largely in New York,
whose position had been established, before the turn of the
century, as the locus of trade and finance. (New York passed
the 500,000 mark in the 1850 census.) This is why, perhaps,
during the ’seventies and ’eighties, decades of miserable depression
throughout the industrial centres, there were signs of
hope and promise in New York: the Museums of Art and
Natural History were built: <cite>Life</cite> and <cite>Puck</cite> and a batch of
newspapers were founded: the Metropolitan Opera House and
Carnegie Hall were established: and a dozen other evidences
of a vigorous civic life appeared. In a short time New York
became the glass of fashion and the mould of form, and through
the standardization, specialization, and centralization which
accompany the machine process the Metropolis became at
length the centre of advertising, the lender of farm mortgages,
the distributor of boiler-plate news, the headquarters
of the popular magazine, the publishing centre, and finally the
chief disseminator of plays and motion pictures in America.
The educational foundations which the exploiter of the Kodak
has established at Rochester were not characteristic of the early
part of the industrial period—otherwise New York’s eminence
might have been briskly challenged before it had become, after
its fashion, unchallengeable. The increment from Mr. Carnegie’s
steel works built a hall of music for New York long
before it created the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh. In
other words, the widespread effort of the American provincial
to leave his industrial city for New York comes to something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
like an attempt to get back from New York what had been
previously filched from the industrial city.</p>

<p>The future of our cities depends upon how permanent are
the forces which drain money, energy, and brains from the various
regions in America into the twelve great cities that now
dominate the countryside, and in turn drain the best that is in
these sub-metropolises to New York. To-day our cities are at
a crossing of the ways. Since the 1910 census a new tendency
has begun to manifest itself, and the cities that have grown
the fastest are those of a population from 25,000 to 100,000.
Quantitatively, that is perhaps a good sign. It may indicate
the drift to Suburbia is on the wane. One finds it much
harder, however, to gauge the qualitative capacities of the
new régime; much more difficult to estimate the likelihood of
building up, within the next generation or two, genuine regional
cultures to take the place of pseudo-national culture which
now mechanically emanates from New York. So far our provincial
culture has been inbred and sterile: our provincial
cities have substituted boosting for achievement, fanciful
speculation for intelligent planning, and a zaniacal optimism
for constructive thought. These habits have made them an
easy prey to the metropolis, for at its lowest ebb there has
always been a certain amount of organized intelligence and
cultivated imagination in New York—if only because it is the
chief point of contact between Europe and America. Gopher
Prairie has yet to take to heart the fable about the frog
that tried to inflate himself to the size of a bull. When Gopher
Prairie learns its lessons from Bergen and Augsburg and Montpellier
and Grenoble, the question of “metropolitanism versus
regionalism” may become as active in America as it is now in
Europe.</p>

<p>Those of us who are metropolitans may be tempted to think
that the hope for civilization in America is bound up with the
continuance of metropolitanism. That is essentially a cockney
view of culture and society, however, and our survey of the
development of the city in America should have done something
to weaken its self-confident complacence. Our metropolitan
civilization is not a success. It is a different kind of wilderness
from that which we have deflowered—but the feral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
rather than the humane quality is dominant: it is still a wilderness.
The cities of America must learn to remould our
mechanical and financial régime, for if metropolitanism continues
they are probably destined to fall by its weight.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Specialists</span> in political archæology will recognize these
sentences: they are from Article I, Sections 2 and 3, of
the constitution of the United States. I have heard and forgotten
how they got there; no doubt the cause lay in the fierce
jealousy of the States. But whatever the fact, I have a notion
that there are few provisions of the constitution that have had
a more profound effect upon the character of practical politics
in the Republic, or, indirectly, upon the general colour of American
thinking in the political department. They have made
steadily for parochialism in legislation, for the security and
prosperity of petty local bosses and machines, for the multiplication
of pocket and rotten boroughs of the worst sort, and,
above all, for the progressive degeneration of the honesty and
honour of representatives. They have greased the ways for
the trashy and ignoble fellow who aspires to get into Congress,
and they have blocked them for the man of sense, dignity, and
self-respect. More, perhaps, than any other single influence
they have been responsible for the present debauched and
degraded condition of the two houses, and particularly of the
lower one. Find me the worst ass in Congress, and I’ll show
you a man they have helped to get there and to stay there.
Find me the most shameless scoundrel, and I’ll show you
another.</p>

<p>No such centripedal mandate, as far as I have been able to
discover, is in the fundamental law of any other country practising
the representative system. An Englishman, if ambition
heads him toward St. Stephen’s, may go hunting for a willing
constituency wherever the hunting looks best, and if he fails<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
in the Midlands he may try again in the South, or in the
North, or in Scotland or Wales. A Frenchman of like dreams
has the same privilege; the only condition, added after nineteen
years of the Third Republic, is that he may not be a candidate
in two or more <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">arrondissements</i> at once. And so with
a German, an Italian, or a Spaniard. But not so with an
American. He must be an actual inhabitant of the State he
aspires to represent at Washington. More, he must be, in all
save extraordinary cases, an actual inhabitant of the congressional
district—for here, by a characteristic American process,
the fundamental law is sharpened by custom. True enough,
this last requirement is not laid down by the constitution. It
would be perfectly legal for the thirty-fifth New York district,
centring at Syracuse, to seek its congressman in Manhattan, or
even at Sing Sing. In various iconoclastic States, in fact, the
thing has been occasionally done. But not often; not often
enough to produce any appreciable effect. The typical congressman
remains a purely local magnifico, the gaudy cock of
some small and usually far from appetizing barnyard. His
rank and dignity as a man are measured by provincial standards
of the most puerile sort, and his capacity to discharge the
various and onerous duties of his office is reckoned almost exclusively
in terms of his ability to hold his grip upon the local
party machine.</p>

<p>If he has genuine ability, it is a sort of accident. If he is
thoroughly honest, it is next door to a miracle. Of the 430-odd
representatives who carry on so diligently and obscenely at
Washington, making laws and determining policies for the
largest free nation ever seen in the world, there are not two
dozen whose views upon any subject under the sun carry any
weight whatsoever outside their own bailiwicks, and there are
not a dozen who rise to anything approaching unmistakable
force and originality. They are, in the overwhelming main,
shallow fellows, ignorant of the grave matters they deal with
and too stupid to learn. If, as is often proposed, the United
States should adopt the plan of parliamentary responsibility
and the ministry should be recruited from the lower house,
then it would be difficult, without a radical change in election
methods, to fetch up even such pale talents and modest decencies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
as were assembled for their cabinets by Messrs. Wilson
and Harding. The better sort of congressmen, to be sure,
acquire after long service a good deal of technical proficiency.
They know the traditions and precedents of the two houses;
they can find their way in and out of every rathole in the
Capitol; they may be trusted to carry on the legislative routine
in a more or less shipshape manner. Of such sort are the specialists
paraded in the newspapers—on the tariff, on military
affairs, on foreign relations, and so on. They come to know,
in time, almost as much as a Washington correspondent, or one
of their own committee clerks. But the average congressman
lifts himself to no such heights of sagacity. He is content to
be led by the fugelmen and bellwethers. Examine him at
leisure, and you will find that he is incompetent and imbecile,
and not only incompetent and imbecile, but also incurably
dishonest. The first principles of civilized law-making are
quite beyond him; he ends, as he began, a local politician, interested
only in jobs. His knowledge is that of a third-rate country
lawyer—which he often is in fact. His intelligence is that
of a country newspaper editor, or evangelical divine. His
standards of honour are those of a country banker—which he
also often is. To demand sense of such a man, or wide and
accurate information, or a delicate feeling for the public and
private proprieties, is to strain his parts beyond endurance.</p>

<p>The constitution, of course, stops with Congress, but its
influence is naturally powerful within the States, and one finds
proofs of the fact on all sides. It is taking an herculean effort
everywhere to break down even the worst effects of this influence;
the prevailing tendency is still to discover a mysterious
virtue in the office-holder who was born and raised in the State,
or county, or city, or ward. The judge must come from the
bar of the court he is to adorn; the mayor must be part and
parcel of the local machine; even technical officers, such as engineers
and health commissioners, lie under the constitutional
blight. The thing began as a belief in local self-government,
the oldest of all the sure cures for despotism. But it has gradually
taken on the character of government by local politicians,
which is to say, by persons quite unable to comprehend the
most elemental problems of State and nation, and unfitted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
nature to deal with them honestly and patriotically, even if they
could comprehend them. Just as prohibition was forced upon
the civilized minorities collected in the great cities against their
most vigorous and persistent opposition, so the same minorities,
when it comes to intra-state affairs, are constantly at the mercy
of predatory bands of rural politicians. If there is any large
American city whose peculiar problems are dealt with competently
and justly by its State legislature, then I must confess
that twenty years in journalism have left me ignorant of it.
An unending struggle for fairer dealing goes on in every State
that has large cities, and every concession to their welfare is
won only at the cost of gigantic effort. The State legislature
is never intelligent; it represents only the average mind of the
county bosses, whose sole concern is with jobs. The machines
that they represent are wholly political, but they have no political
principles in any rational sense. Their one purpose and
function is to maintain their adherents in the public offices,
or to obtain for them in some other way a share of the State
funds. They are quite willing to embrace any new doctrine,
however fantastic, or to abandon any old one, however long
supported, if only the business will promote their trade and
so secure their power.</p>

<p>This concentration of the ultimate governmental authority
in the hands of small groups of narrow, ignorant, and unconscionable
manipulators tends inevitably to degrade the actual
office-holder, or, what is the same thing, to make office-holding
prohibitive to all men not already degraded. It is almost
impossible to imagine a man of genuine self-respect and dignity
offering himself as a candidate for the lower house—or, since
the direct primary and direct elections brought it down to the
common level, for the upper house—in the average American
constituency. His necessary dealings with the electors themselves,
and with the idiots who try more or less honestly to lead
them, would be revolting enough, but even worse would be his
need of making terms with the professional politicians of his
party—the bosses of the local machine. These bosses naturally
make the most of the constitutional limitation; it works
powerfully in their favour. A local notable, in open revolt
against them, may occasionally beat them by appealing directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
to the voters, but nine times out of ten, when there is any sign
of such a catastrophe, they are prompt to perfume the ticket
by bringing forth another local notable who is safe and sane,
which is to say, subservient and reliable. The thing is done
constantly; it is a matter of routine; it accounts for most
of the country bankers, newspaper owners, railroad lawyers,
proprietors of cement works, and other such village bigwigs
in the lower house. Here everything runs to the advantage
of the bosses. It is not often that the notable in rebellion
is gaudy enough to blind the plain people to the high merits of
his more docile opponent. They see him too closely and know
him too well. He shows none of that exotic charm which accounts,
on a different plane, for exogamy. There is no strangeness,
no mysteriousness, above all, no novelty about him.</p>

<p>It is my contention that this strangle-hold of the local machines
would be vastly less firm if it could be challenged, not
only by rebels within the constituency, but also by salient men
from outside. The presidential campaigns, indeed, offer plenty
of direct proof of it. In these campaigns it is a commonplace
for strange doctrines and strange men to force themselves upon
the practical politicians in whole sections of the country, despite
their constant effort to keep their followers faithful to
the known. All changes, of whatever sort, whether in leaders
or in ideas, are opposed by such politicians at the start, but
time after time they are compelled to acquiesce and to hurrah.
Bryan, as every one knows, forced himself upon the Democratic
party by appealing directly to the people; the politicians, in
the main, were bitterly against him until further resistance
was seen to be useless, and they attacked him again the moment
he began to weaken, and finally disposed of him. So with
Wilson. It would be absurd to say that the politicians of his
party—and especially the bosses of the old machines in the
congressional districts—were in favour of him in 1912. They
were actually against him almost unanimously. He got past
their guard and broke down their resolution to nominate some
more trustworthy candidate by operating directly upon the
emotions of the voters. For some reason never sufficiently
explained he became the heir of the spirit of rebellion raised
by Bryan sixteen years before, and was given direct and very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
effective aid by Bryan himself. Roosevelt saddled himself
upon the Republican party in exactly the same way. The
bosses made heroic efforts to sidetrack him, to shelve him, to
get rid of him by any means short of homicide, but his bold
enterprises and picturesque personality enchanted the people,
and if it had not been for the extravagant liberties that he took
with his popularity in later years he might have retained it until
his death.</p>

<p>The same possibility of unhorsing the machine politicians, I
believe, exists in even the smallest electoral unit. All that is
needed is the chance to bring in the man. Podunk cannot produce
him herself, save by a sort of miracle. If she has actually
hatched him, he is far away by the time he has come to his
full stature and glitter—in the nearest big city, in Chicago
or New York. Podunk is proud of him, and many other
Podunks, perhaps, are stirred by his ideas, his attitudes, his
fine phrases—but he lives, say, in some Manhattan congressional
district which has the Hon. Patrick Googan as its representative
by divine right, and so there is no way to get him
into the halls of Congress. In his place goes the Hon. John
P. Balderdash, State’s attorney for five years, State senator for
two terms, and county judge for a brief space—and always a
snide and petty fellow, always on the best of terms with the
local bosses, always eager for a job on any terms they lay down.
The yokels vote for the Hon. Mr. Balderdash, not because they
admire him, but because their only choice is between him and
the Hon. James Bosh. If anything even remotely resembling
a first-rate man could come into the contest, if it were lawful
for them to rid themselves of their recurrent dilemma by soliciting
the interest of such a man, then they would often
enough rise in their might and compel their parish overlords,
as the English put it, to adopt him. But the constitution protects
these overlords in their business, and in the long run the
voters resign all thought of deliverance. Thus the combat
remains one between small men, and interest in it dies out.
Most of the men who go to the lower house are third-raters,
even in their own narrow bailiwicks. In my own congressional
district, part of a large city, there has never been a candidate
of any party, during the twenty years that I have voted, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
was above the intellectual level of a corner grocer. No successful
candidate of that district has ever made a speech in
Congress (or out of it) worth hearing, or contributed a single
sound idea otherwise to the solution of any public problem.
One and all, they have confined themselves exclusively to the
trade in jobs. One and all, they have been ciphers in the house
and before the country.</p>

<p>Well, perhaps I labour my point too much. It is, after all,
not important. The main thing is the simple fact that the
average representative from my district is typical of Congress—that,
if anything, he is superior to the normal congressman
of these, our days. That normal congressman, as year chases
year, tends to descend to such depths of puerility, to such
abysses of petty shysterism, that he becomes offensive alike to
the intelligence and to the nose. His outlook, when it is honest,
is commonly childish—and it is very seldom honest. The
product of a political system which puts all stress upon the
rewards of public office, he is willing to make any sacrifice,
of dignity, of principle, of honour, to hold and have those
rewards. He has no courage, no intellectual <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">amour propre</i>, no
ardent belief in anything save his job, and the jobs of his
friends. It was easy for Wilson to beat him into line on the
war issue; it was easy for the prohibitionists to intimidate and
stampede him; it is easy for any resolute man or group of men
to do likewise. I read the <cite>Congressional Record</cite> faithfully,
and have done so for years. In the Senate debates, amid
oceans of tosh, I occasionally encounter a flash of wit or a
gleam of sense; direct elections have not yet done their work.
But in the lower house there is seldom anything save a garrulous
and intolerable imbecility. The discussion of measures
of the utmost importance—bills upon which the security and
prosperity of the whole nation depend—is carried on in the
manner of the Chautauqua and the rural stump. Entire days
go by without a single congressman saying anything as intelligent,
say, as the gleams that one sometimes finds in the New
York <cite>Herald</cite>, or even in the New York <cite>Times</cite>. The newspapers,
unfortunately, give no adequate picture of the business.
No American journal reports the daily debates comprehensively,
as the debates in the House of Commons are reported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
by the London <cite>Times</cite>, <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>, and <cite>Morning Post</cite>.
All one hears of, as a rule, is the action taken, and only too
often the action taken, even when it is reported fairly, is unintelligible
without the antecedent discussion. If any one who
reads this wants to know what such a discussion is like, then
I counsel him to go to the nearest public library, ask for the
<cite>Record</cite> for 1918, and read the debate in the lower house on the
Volstead Act. It was, I believe, an average debate, and on a
subject of capital importance. It was, from first to last, almost
fabulous in its evasion of the plain issue, its incredible timorousness
and stupidity, its gross mountebankery and dishonesty.
Not twenty men spoke in it as men of honour and self-respect.
Not ten brought any idea into it that was not a silly idea and
a stale one.</p>

<p>That debate deserves a great deal more study than it will
ever get from the historians of American politics, nearly all of
whom, whether they lean to the right or to the left, are bedazzled
by the economic interpretation of history, and so seek
to account for all political phenomena in terms of crop movements,
wage scales, and panics in Wall Street. It seems to me
that that obsession blinds them to a fact of the first importance,
to wit, the fact that political ideas, under a democracy as under
a monarchy, originate above quite as often as they originate
below, and that their popularity depends quite as much upon
the special class interests of professional politicians as it depends
upon the underlying economic interests of the actual
voters. It is, of course, true, as I have argued, that the people
can force ideas upon the politicians, given powerful leaders of
a non-political (or, at all events, non-machine) sort, but it is
equally true that there are serious impediments to the process,
and that it is not successful very often. As a matter of everyday
practice the rise and fall of political notions is determined
by the self-interest of the practical politicians of the country,
and though they naturally try to bring the business into harmony
with any great popular movements that may be in progress
spontaneously, they by no means wait and beg for mandates
when none are vociferously forthcoming, but go ahead
bravely on their own account, hoping to drag public opinion
with them and so safeguard their jobs. Such is the origin of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
many affecting issues, later held dear by millions of the plain
people. Such was the process whereby prohibition was foisted
upon the nation by constitutional amendment, to the dismay of
the solid majority opposed to it and to the surprise of the
minority in favour of it.</p>

<p>What lay under the sudden and melodramatic success of the
prohibitionist agitators was simply their discovery of the incurable
cowardice and venality of the normal American politician—their
shrewd abandonment of logical and evidential
propaganda for direct political action. For years their cause
had languished. Now and then a State or part of a State
went dry, but often it went wet again a few years later. Those
were the placid days of white-ribbon rallies, of wholesale
pledge-signings, of lectures by converted drunkards, of orgiastic
meetings in remote Baptist and Methodist churches, of a childish
reliance upon arguments that fetched only drunken men
and their wives, and so grew progressively feebler as the country
became more sober. The thing was scarcely even a
nuisance; it tended steadily to descend to the level of a joke.
The prohibitionist vote for President hung around a quarter
of a million; it seemed impossible to pull it up to a formidable
figure, despite the stupendous labours of thousands of eloquent
dervishes, lay and clerical, male and female. But then, out of
nowhere, came the Anti-Saloon League, and—sis! boom! ah!
Then came the sudden shift of the fire from the people to the
politicians—and at once there was rapid progress. The people
could only be wooed and bamboozled, but the politicians could
be threatened; their hold upon their jobs could be shaken; they
could be converted at wholesale and by <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">force majeure</i>. The
old prohibition weepers and gurglers were quite incapable of
this enterprise, but the new janissaries of the Anti-Saloon
League—sharp lawyers, ecclesiastics too ambitious to pound
mere pulpits, outlaw politicians seeking a way back to the
trough—were experts at every trick and dodge it demanded.
They understood the soul of the American politician. To him
they applied the economic interpretation of history, resolutely
and with a great deal of genial humour. They knew that his
whole politics, his whole philosophy, his whole concept of honesty
and honour, was embraced in his single and insatiable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
yearning for a job, and they showed him how, by playing with
them, he could get it and keep it, and how, by standing against
them, he could lose it. Prohibition was rammed into the constitution
by conquering the politicians; the people in general
were amazed when the thing was accomplished; it may take
years to reconcile them to it.</p>

<p>It was the party system that gave the Anti-Saloon League
manipulators their chance, and they took advantage of it with
great boldness and cleverness. The two great parties divide
the country almost equally; it is difficult to predict, in a given
year, whether the one or the other musters the most votes.
This division goes down into the lowest electoral units; even
in those backward areas where one party has divine grace and
the other is of the devil there are factional differences that
amount to the same thing. In other words, the average American
politician is never quite sure of his job. An election (and,
if not an election, then a primary) always exposes him to a
definite hazard, and he is eager to diminish it by getting help
from outside his own following, at whatever cost to the principles
he commonly professes. Here lies the opportunity for
minorities willing to trade on a realistic political basis. In the
old days the prohibitionists refused to trade, and in consequence
they were disregarded, for their fidelity to their own
grotesque candidates protected the candidates of both the regular
parties. But with the coming of the Anti-Saloon League
they abandoned this fidelity and began to dicker in a forthright
and unashamed manner, quickly comprehensible to all professional
politicians. That is, they asked for a pledge on one
specific issue, and were willing to swallow any commitment on
other issues. If Beelzebub, running on one ticket, agreed to
support prohibition, and the Archangel Gabriel, running on another,
found himself entertaining conscientious doubts, they
were instantly and solidly for Beelzebub, and they not only
gave him the votes that they directly controlled, but they also
gave him the benefit of a campaign support that was ruthless,
pertinacious, extraordinarily ingenious, and overwhelmingly effective.
Beelzebub, whatever his swinishness otherwise, was
bathed in holy oils; Gabriel’s name became a thing to scare
children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p>Obviously, the support thus offered was particularly tempting
to a politician who found himself facing public suspicion
for his general political practices—in brief, to the worst type
of machine professional. Such a politician is always acutely
aware that it is not positive merit that commonly gets a man
into public office in the United States, but simply disvulnerability.
Even when they come to nominate a President, the
qualities the two great parties seek are chiefly the negative
ones; they want, not a candidate of forceful and immovable
ideas, but one whose ideas are vague and not too tenaciously
held, and in whose personality there is nothing to alarm or
affront the populace. Of two candidates, that one usually wins
who least arouses the distrusts and suspicions of the great
masses of undifferentiated men. This advantage of the safe
and sane, the colourless and unprovocative, the apparently
stodgy and commonplace man extends to the most trivial contests,
and politicians are keen to make use of it. Thus the job-seeker
with an aura of past political misdemeanour about him
was eager to get the Christian immunity bath that the prohibitionists
offered him so generously, and in the first years of
their fight they dealt almost exclusively with such fellows.
He, on his side, promised simply to vote for prohibition—not
even, in most cases, to pretend to any personal belief in it.
The prohibitionists, on their side, promised to deliver the votes
of their followers to him on election day, to cry him up as one
saved by a shining light, and, most important of all, to denounce
his opponent as an agent of hell. He was free, by this agreement,
to carry on his regular political business as usual. The
prohibitionists asked no patronage of him. They didn’t afflict
him with projects for other reforms. All they demanded was
that he cast his vote as agreed upon when the signal was given
to him.</p>

<p>At the start, of course, such scoundrels frequently violated
their agreements. In the South, in particular, dry legislature
after dry legislature sold out to the liquor lobby, which, in those
days, still had plenty of money. An assemblyman would be
elected with the aid of the prohibitionists, make a few maudlin
speeches against the curse of drink, and then, at the last minute,
vote wet for some thin and specious reason, or for no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
avowed reason at all. But the prohibition manipulators, as I
have said, were excellent politicians, and so they knew how
to put down that sort of treason. At the next election they
transferred their favour to the opposition candidate, and inasmuch
as he had seen the traitor elected at the last election
he was commonly very eager to do business. The punishment
for the treason was condign and merciless. The dry rabble-rousers,
lay and clerical, trumpeted news of it from end to end
of the constituency. What was a new and gratifying disvulnerability
was transformed into a vulnerability of the worst
sort; the recreant one became the county Harry Thaw, Oscar
Wilde, Captain Boy-Ed, and Debs. A few such salutary examples,
and treason became rare. The prohibitionists, indeed,
came to prefer dealing with such victims of their reprisals.
They could trust them perfectly, once the lesson had been
learned; they were actually more trustworthy than honest believers,
for the latter usually had ideas of their own and interfered
with the official plans of campaign. Thus, in the end,
the professional politicians of both parties came under the yoke.
The final battle in Congress transcended all party lines; democrats
and republicans fought alike for places on the band-wagon.
The spectacle offered a searching and not unhumorous
commentary on the party system, and on the honour of
American politicians no less. Two-thirds, at least, of the votes
for the amendment were cast by men who did not believe in it,
and who cherished a hearty hope, to the last moment, that some
act of God would bring about its defeat.</p>

<p>Such holocausts of frankness and decency are certainly not
rare in American politics; on the contrary, they glow with
normalcy. The typical legislative situation among us—and
the typical administrative situation as well—is one in which
men wholly devoid of inner integrity, facing a minority that is
resolutely determined to get its will, yield up their ideas, their
freedom, and their honour in order to save their jobs. I say
administrative situation as well; what I mean is that in these
later days the pusillanimity of the actual law-maker is fully
matched by the pusillanimity of the enforcing officer, whether
humble assistant district attorney or powerful judge. The
war, with its obliteration of customary pretences and loosening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
of fundamental forces, threw up the whole process into high
relief. For nearly two long years there was a complete abandonment
of sense and self-respect. Rowelled and intimidated
by minorities that finally coalesced into a frantic majority,
legislators allowed themselves to be forced into imbecility after
imbecility, and administrative officers, including some of the
highest judges in the land, followed them helter-skelter. In
the lower house of Congress there was one man—already forgotten—who
showed the stature of a man. He resigned his
seat and went home to his self-respect. The rest had no
self-respect to go home to. Eager beyond all to hold their
places, at whatever cost to principle, and uneasily conscious of
their vulnerability to attack, however frenzied and unjust, they
surrendered abjectly and repeatedly—to the White House, to
the newspapers, to any group enterprising enough to issue orders
to them and resolute enough to flourish weapons before
them. It was a spectacle full of indecency—there are even
congressmen who blush when they think of it to-day—but
it was nevertheless a spectacle that was typical. The fortunes
of politics, as they now run, make it overwhelmingly probable
that every new recruit to public office will be just such a poltroon.
The odds are enormously in favour of him, and enormously
against the man of honour. Such a man of honour
may occasionally drift in, taken almost unawares by some
political accident, but it is the pushing, bumptious, unconscionable
bounder who is constantly <em>fighting</em> to get in, and only
too often he succeeds. The rules of the game are made to fit
his taste and his talents. He can survive as a hog can survive
in the swill-yard.</p>

<p>Go to the Congressional Directory and investigate the origins
and past performances of the present members of the lower
house—our typical assemblage of typical politicians, the cornerstone
of our whole representative system, the symbol of our
democracy. You will find that well over half of them are
obscure lawyers, school-teachers, and mortgage-sharks out of
almost anonymous towns—men of common traditions, sordid
aspirations, and no attainments at all. One and all, the members
of this majority—and it is constant, no matter what party
is in power—are plastered with the brass ornaments of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
more brummagem fraternal orders. One and all, they are devoid
of any contact with what passes for culture, even in their
remote bailiwicks. One and all their careers are bare of
civilizing influences.... Such is the American <em>Witenagemot</em>
in this 146th year of the Republic. Such are the men who
make the laws that all of us must obey, and who carry on our
dealings with the world. Go to their debates, and you will
discover what equipment they bring to their high business.
What they know of sound literature is what one may get out of
McGuffey’s Fifth Reader. What they know of political science
is the nonsense preached in the chautauquas and on the
stump. What they know of history is the childish stuff taught
in grammar-schools. What they know of the arts and sciences—of
all the great body of knowledge that is the chief intellectual
baggage of modern man—is absolutely nothing.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="JOURNALISM">JOURNALISM</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">According</span> to the <cite>World Almanac</cite> for 1921 the daily circulation
of newspapers in the big cities of the United
States in 1914 (evidently the most recent year for which the
figures have been compiled) was more than forty million. For
the six months ending April 1, 1920, the average daily circulation
of five morning newspapers and eleven evening newspapers
in Greater New York City was, as shown by sworn
statements, more than three and a third million. These statistics
cover only daily newspapers, not weekly or monthly
journals; and the figures for New York do not include papers
in languages other than English. The American certainly
buys newspapers. To what extent he reads them it is impossible
to determine. But we may fairly assume that the great
majority of literate inhabitants of the United States of all ages
are every day subjected in some measure to the influence of the
newspaper. No other institution approaches the newspaper in
universality, persistence, continuity of influence. Not the
public school, with all other schools added to it, has such
power over the national mind; for in the lives of most people
formal schooling is of relatively short duration, ceasing with
adolescence or earlier. The church? Millions of people never
go to church, and the day when the clergy dominated human
thought is gone for ever. If we add to the daily press the
weekly and monthly periodicals, with a total circulation per
issue of two hundred million (for the year 1914), we shall not
be far wrong in saying that the journalist, with the powers
behind him, has more to do, for good or for evil, than the
member of any other profession, in creating and shaping the
thoughts of the multitude. Compared with him the teacher,
the preacher, the artist, the politician, the man of science, are
restricted, interrupted, indirect in reaching the minds of their
fellow-men.</p>

<p>So that in estimating the capacities and contents of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
American mind, which we have no means of lining up in its
hundred million individual manifestations and examining directly,
an analysis of the American newspaper is a fair rough-and-ready
method. What everybody reads does not tell the
whole story of what everybody is, but it tells a good deal.
Moreover, it is not necessary to analyze any one newspaper
or to separate its clientèle from that of any other newspaper.
For though everybody knows that the New York <cite>Tribune</cite> and
the New York <cite>World</cite> have distinct qualities which differentiate
them from each other, that some papers are better and some
are worse, yet on the whole the American newspaper is amazingly
uniform from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon. It
is, indeed, a more or less unified institution fed by the same
news services and dominated by kindred financial interests.
If you travel much, as actors do, without interest in local
affairs, when you go to the hotel news-stand in the morning,
you cannot tell from the general aspect of the newspaper you
pick up what city you are in; and in a small city it is likely
to be a metropolitan paper that has come a hundred miles or
more during the night. Indeed, this is the first thing to be
learned about the American from a study of his newspapers,
that he lacks individuality, is tediously uniform, and cut according
to one intellectual pattern. He may have his “favourite”
newspaper, and with no sense that his confession of
habitude is shameful he may write the editor that he has read
it constantly for forty years. But if it goes out of existence,
like his favourite brand of chewing-gum or cigarettes, there is
no aching void which cannot be comfortably filled by a surviving
competitor. Editors, except those in charge of local news,
move with perfect ease from one city to another; it is the same
old job at a different desk.</p>

<p>The standardization of the newspaper reader and the standardization
of the journalist are two aspects of the same thing.
As a citizen, a workman, a human being, the journalist is simply
one of us, a victim of the conformity which has overwhelmed
the American. When we speak of the influence of
the journalist, we are not speaking of an individual, but of “the
powers behind him,” of which he is nothing but the wage-earning
servant, as impotent and unimportant, considered as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
an individual, as a mill-hand. Journalism in America is no
longer a profession, through which a man can win to a place
of real dignity among his neighbours. If we had a Horace
Greeley to-day, he would not be editor of a newspaper. He
would not wish to be, and he would not be allowed to be. Certainly
his vigorous integrity would not be tolerated in the modern
unworthy successor of the newspaper which he founded.
The editor of a newspaper is no doubt often a man of intelligence
and experience and he may be well paid, like the manager
of a department store; but he is usually submerged in
anonymity except that from time to time the law requires the
newspaper to publish his name. His subordinates, assistant
editors, newswriters, reporters, and the rest, are as nameless
as floor-walkers, shipping clerks, salesladies, and ladies engaged
in more ancient forms of commerce.</p>

<p>It is true that during the last generation there has been
a tendency in the newspaper to “feature” individuals, such
as cartoonists, conductors of columns, writers on sport, dramatic
critics, and so on. But these men are artists, some of them
very clever, who have nothing to do with the news but contribute
to the paper its vaudeville entertainment. During
the war there was a great increase in the amount of signed
cable matter and correspondence. This was due to the necessity
of the prosperous newspaper to show its enterprise and to
cajole its readers into believing that it had men of special ability
in close touch with diplomats and major-generals collecting and
cabling at great expense intimate information and expert opinion.
The circumstances were so difficult that the wisest and
most honest man could not do much, except lose his position,
and nobody will blame the correspondents. But it is significant
that not a single American correspondent emerged from
the conflict who is memorable, from the point of view of a
more or less careful reader, as having been different from the
rest. If from a miscellaneous collection of clippings we should
cut off the dates, the alleged place of origin and the names
of the correspondents, nobody but an editor with a long and
detailed memory could tell t’other from which, or be sure
whether the despatch was from Mr. Jones, the special correspondent
of the <cite>Christian Science Monitor</cite> (copyright by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
Chicago <cite>News</cite>) or an anonymous cable from the London office
of the Associated Press. And even the editor, who may be
assumed to know the names of hundreds of his colleagues and
competitors, would begin his attempt at identification by examining
the style of type to see if it looked like a column from
the <cite>Sun</cite> or from the <cite>World</cite>. Almost all the war news was a
hopeless confusion of impressions, of reports of what somebody
said somebody else, “of unquestionable authority,” had
heard from reliable sources, and of sheer mendacity adapted to
the momentary prejudices of the individual managing editor,
the American press as a whole, and the American people. And
this is a rough recipe for all the news even in times of peace,
for the war merely aggravated the prevalent diseases of the
newspapers.</p>

<p>Since the purpose of this book is to discuss peculiarly American
characteristics, it should be said at once that the tendency
of the newspaper to obliterate the journalist as a person immediately
responsible to the public is not confined to America.
Economic conditions in Europe and America are fundamentally
alike, and the modern newspaper in every country must be a
business institution, heavily capitalized, and conducted for
profit. In England the decline of journalism as a profession
and the rise of the “stunt” press has been noted and deplored
by Englishmen. Years ago it meant something to be editor
of the London <cite>Times</cite>, and the appointment of a new man to
the position was an event not less important than a change in
the cabinet. Who is editor of the <cite>Times</cite> now is a matter of no
consequence except to the man who receives the salary check.
English journalism is in almost as bad a case as American. In
England, however, there is at least one exception which
has no counterpart in America, the Manchester Guardian;
this admirable newspaper has the good fortune to be owned
by people who are so rich that they are not obliged, and so
honest that they are not willing, to sell out. It is this fact
which has afforded Mr. Scott, the editor-in-chief for nearly
half a century, an opportunity adequate to his courage and
ability. There are few such opportunities in England, and
none in America. Even the Springfield <cite>Republican</cite> has largely
lost its old character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p>As for the continental papers, one who does not read any of
them regularly is in no position to judge. In 1900 William
James, a shrewd observer, wrote in a letter: “The Continental
papers of course are ‘nowhere.’ As for our yellow papers—every
country has its criminal classes, and with us and in
France, they have simply got into journalism as part of their
professional evolution, and they must be got out. Mr. Bosanquet
somewhere says that so far from the ‘dark ages’ being
over, we are just at the beginning of a new dark-age period.
He means that ignorance and unculture, which then were
merely brutal, are now articulate and possessed of a literary
voice, and the fight is transferred from fields and castles and
town walls to ‘organs of publicity.’” This is only a passing
remark in an informal letter. But it is a partial explanation
of American yellow journalism which in twenty years has
swamped the whole press, including papers that pretend to be
respectable, and it suggests what the state of things was, and
is, in France.</p>

<p>It should be noted, however, that personal journalism has
not entirely disappeared in France, that the editor can still be
brought to account, sometimes at the point of a pistol, for lies
and slander, and that a young French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">littérateur</i>, before he
has won his spurs in poetry, drama, or fiction, can regard journalism
as an honourable occupation in which it is worth while
to make a name.</p>

<p>With the decadence in all countries, certainly in America, of
the journalist as a professional man in an honourable craft,
there might conceivably have been a gain in objectivity, in the
right sort of impersonality. Anonymity might have ensured a
dispassionate fidelity to facts. But there has been no such
gain. Responsibility has been transferred from the journalist
to his employers, and he is on his mettle to please his employers,
to cultivate whatever virtues are possible to journalism,
accuracy, clearness of expression, zeal in searching out
and interpreting facts, only in so far forth as his employers
demand them, only as his livelihood and chances of promotion
depend on them. The ordinary journalist, being an ordinary
human being, must prefer to do honest work; for there is no
pleasure in lying, though there is a temptation to fill space with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
unfounded or unverified statements. And if his manager orders
him to find a story where there is no story, or to find a
story of a certain kind where the facts lead to a story of another
kind, he will not come back empty-handed lest he go
away empty-handed on pay-day. Any one who has worked in
a newspaper office knows that the older men are likely to be
weary and cynical and that the younger men fall into two
classes, those who are too stupid to be discontented with any
aspect of their position except the size of their salaries, and
those who hope either to rise to the better paid positions, or
to “graduate,” as they put it, from daily journalism to other
kinds of literary work.</p>

<p>The journalist, then, should be acquitted of most of the
faults of journalism. Mr. Walter Lippmann says in his sane
little book, “Liberty and the News”: “Resistance to the
inertias of the profession, heresy to the institution, and willingness
to be fired rather than write what you do not believe,
these wait on nothing but personal courage.” That is a little
like saying that the harlot can stop harlotry by refusing to ply
her trade—which is indeed the attitude of some people in comfortable
circumstances. I doubt if Mr. Lippmann would have
written just as he did if he had ever had to depend for his
dinner on pleasing a managing editor, if he had not been from
very early in his brilliant career editor of a liberal endowed
journal in which he is free to express his beliefs. Most newspaper
men are poor and not brilliant. The correspondents
whom Mr. Lippmann mentions as “eminences on a rather
flat plateau” are nearly all men who have succeeded in other
work than newspaper correspondence, and if not a newspaper
in the world would hire them, most of them could afford to
thumb their noses at the Ochses, Reids, and Harmsworths.
Personal courage is surely a personal matter, and it can seldom
be effective in correcting the abuses of an institution, especially
when the institution can hire plenty of men of adequate if not
equal ability to take the place of the man of stubborn integrity.
I know one journalist who lost his position as managing editor
of two wealthy newspapers, one in Boston, the other in New
York, in the first instance because he refused to print a false
and cowardly retraction dictated by a stockholder whom the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
editor-in-chief desired to serve, in the second instance because
he refused to distort war news. But what good did his single-handed
rebellion do, except to make a few friends proud of
him? Did either newspaper lose even one mournful subscriber?
Did the advertising department suffer? Far from it. Another
man took his place, a man not necessarily less honest, but of
more conformable temperament. The muddy waters of journalism
did not show a ripple. Paradoxically, the journalist is
the one man who can do little or nothing to improve journalism.
Mr. Lippmann’s suggestion that our salvation lies “ultimately
in the infusion of the news-structure by men with a new training
and outlook,” is, as he knows, the expression of a vague hope,
too remotely ultimate to have practical bearing on the actual
situation. The man of training and outlook, especially of outlook,
is the unhappiest man in the employ of a newspaper. His
salvation, if not ours, lies in getting out of newspaper work and
applying his ability and vision in some occupation which does
not discourage precisely the merits which an honest institution
should foster. This is not merely the opinion of a critical
layman but represents accurately if not literally the advice
given to me by a successful editor and writer of special articles.
“In this game,” he said, “you lose your soul.”</p>

<p>The stories of individuals who have tried to be decent in
newspaper work and have been fired might be valuable if they
were collated and if the better journalists would unite to lay
the foundation in fact of more such stories. But a profession,
a trade, which has so little sense of its own interest that it
does not even make an effective union (to be sure, the organization
of newspaper writers met with some success, especially
in Boston, but to-day the organization has practically disappeared)
to keep its wages up can never be expected to unite
in the impersonal interests of truth and intellectual dignity.
The individual who charges against an enormous unshakable
institution with the weapons of his personal experience is too
easily disposed of as a sore-head and is likely to be laughed
at even by his fellow-journalists who know that in the main
he is right.</p>

<p>This has happened to Mr. Upton Sinclair. I have studied
“The Brass Check” carefully for the selfish purpose of getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
enough material so that the writing of this chapter should be
nothing but a lazy man’s task of transcription, not to speak of
the noble ethical purpose of reforming the newspaper by exposing
its iniquities. I confess I am disappointed. “The
Brass Check” is a mixture of autobiography, valuable in its way
to those who admire Mr. Sinclair, as I do most sincerely, and
of evidence which, though properly personal, ought to be
handled in an objective manner. I am puzzled that a man of
“training and outlook,” who has shown in at least one of his
novels an excellent sense of construction, could throw together
such a hodge-podge of valid testimony, utterly damning to
his opponents, and naïve trivialities, assertions insecurely
founded and not important if they were well founded. I am
so sure that Mr. Sinclair is on the whole right that I am reluctant
to criticize him adversely, to lend a shadow of encouragement
to the real adversary, who is unscrupulous and securely
entrenched. But as a journalist of “training and outlook”
I lament that another journalist of vastly more ability,
experience, and information should not have done better work
in selecting and constructing his material. As a lawyer said to
his client, “You are a saint and you are right, but a court-room
is no place for a saint and you are a damn bad witness.”
Mr. Sinclair’s evidence, however, is all there to be dug out
by whoever has the will and the patience. If one-tenth of it
is valid and nine-tenths of doubtful value, the one-tenth is
sufficient to show the sinister forces behind the newspapers and
to explain some of the reasons why the newspapers are untrustworthy,
cowardly, and dishonest.</p>

<p>Though Mr. Sinclair tells some damaging stories about the
sins of anonymous reporters and of the prostitution of writers
like the late Elbert Hubbard, who had no excuse for being
anything but honest and independent, yet Mr. Sinclair on the
whole would agree with me that the chief responsibility for
the evils of journalism does not rest upon the journalist. He
tries to place it squarely where it belongs on the owners of
the press and the owners of the owners. But it is difficult to
determine how the weight of guilt is distributed, for the press
is a monster with more than two legs.</p>

<p>Part of the responsibility rests upon the reader, if indeed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
the reader is to blame for being a gullible fool and for buying
shoddy goods. Mr. Lippmann says: “There is everywhere an
increasingly angry disillusionment about the press, a growing
sense of being baffled and misled.” And Mr. Sinclair says:
“The people want the news; the people clamour for the news.”
Both these statements may be true. But where do the learned
doctors find the symptoms? A few of us who have some
special interest in the press, in publicity, in political problems,
are disillusioned and resentful. Probably everybody has said
or heard somebody else say: “That’s only a newspaper story,”
or “You cannot believe everything you read.” But such mild
scepticism shows no promise of swelling to an angry demand on
the part of that vague aggregate, the People, for better, more
honest newspapers, to such an angry demand as you can actually
hear in any house you enter for cheaper clothes and
lower taxes.</p>

<p>If we make a rough calculation of the number of papers sold
and of the number of people in the main economic classes, it is
evident that papers of large circulation must go by the million
to the working-people. Well, is there any sign of growing
wrath in the breasts of the honest toilers against the newspapers,
against Mr. Hearst’s papers, which throw them sops
of hypocritical sympathy, not to speak of papers which are
openly unfair in handling labour news? Or consider the more
prosperous classes. In the smoking-car of any suburban train
bound for New York some morning after eight o’clock, look at
the men about you, business men, the kind that work, or do
something, in offices. They are reading the <cite>Times</cite> and the
<cite>Tribune</cite>. There may be some growls about something in the
day’s news, something that has happened on the stock-market,
or a stupid throw to third base in yesterday’s game. But is
there any murmur of discontent with the newspaper itself? I
fail to find any evidence of widespread disgust with the newspaper
as it is and a concomitant hunger for something better.
The Reader, the Public is mute, if not inglorious, and
accepts uncritically what the daily press provides. The reader
has not much opportunity to choose the better from the worse.
If he gives up one paper he must take another that is just as
bad. He is between the devil and the deep sea, as when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
casts his ballot for Democrat or Republican. And if he votes
Socialist he gets the admirable New York <cite>Call</cite>, which is less a
newspaper than a vehicle of propaganda. When one paper is
slightly more honest and intelligent than its rivals, the difference
is so slight that only those especially interested in the
problems of the press are aware of it. For example, in discussing
these problems with newspaper men, with critical readers
of the press, persons for any reason intelligently interested
in the problems, I have never found one who did not have
a good word to say for the New York <cite>Globe</cite>. It is so appreciably
more decent than the other New York papers that I can
almost forgive it for thrusting Dr. Frank Crane under my
nose when I am looking at the amusing pictures of Mr. Fontaine
Fox—the newspaper vaudeville has to supply stunts for
all juvenile tastes. Yet the <cite>Globe</cite> does not find a clamorous
multitude willing to reward it for its superiority to its neighbours,
which I grant is too slight for duffers to discern. The
American reader of newspapers, that is, almost everybody, is
a duffer, so far as the newspaper is concerned, uncritical, docile,
only meekly incredulous. It may be that “the people” get as
good newspapers as they wish and deserve, just as they are said
to get as good government as they wish and deserve. Certainly
if the readers of newspapers seem to demand nothing
better, the manufacturers of newspapers have no inducement to
give them anything better. But this does not get us any
nearer a solution of the problem or do more than indicate that
some vaguely indeterminate part of the responsibility for the
evils of the newspapers must rest on the people who buy them.</p>

<p>From the buyer to the seller is the shortest step. The newspaper
is a manufacturing concern producing goods to sell at a
profit; it is also a department store, and it has some characteristics
that suggest the variety show and the brothel. But
the newspaper differs from all other commodities in that it does
not live by what it receives from the consumer who buys it.
Three cents multiplied a million times does not support a newspaper.
The valuable part of a newspaper from the manufacturer’s
point of view, and also to a great extent from the
reader’s point of view, is the advertisements. The columns of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
“reading matter,” so called, are little more than bait to attract
enough readers to make the paper worth while as a vehicle
for advertisements. It is of no importance to the management
whether a given column contain news from Washington or
Moscow, true or false, or a scandal or a funny story, as long
as it leads some thousands of human eyes to look at it and so
to look at adjacent columns in which are set forth the merits
of a safety razor or an automobile tire or a fifty-dollar suit
of clothes at thirty-nine dollars and a half. There has to be
a good variety and a certain balance of interest in the columns
of reading matter to secure the attention of all kinds of people.
This accounts for two things, the great development in the
newspaper of pure, or impure, entertainment, of more or less
clever features, at the expense of space that might be devoted
to news, and also the tendency to accentuate narrative interest
above all other kinds of interest. A reporter is never sent out
by his chief to get information, but always, in the lingo of the
office, to get a “story.” This is sound psychology. Everybody
likes a story, and there are only a few souls in the world
who yearn at breakfast for information. To attack the newspaper
for being sensational is to forget that all the great stories
of the world, from the amatory exploits of Helen of Troy and
Cleopatra to the scandalous adventures of Mrs. Black, the
banker’s wife, are sensational and should be so treated. The
newspaper manager is indifferent to every quality in his news
columns except their power to attract the reader and so secure
circulation and so please the advertiser. And the advertiser
has as his primary interest only that of bringing to the attention
of a certain number of people the virtues of his suspenders,
shoes, and soothing syrup.</p>

<p>But the advertiser has a secondary interest. The newspaper
willy-nilly deals with ideas, such as they are. No idea inimical
to the advertiser’s business or in general to the business system
of which he is a dependent part must be allowed in the paper.
Therefore all newspapers are controlled by the advertising department,
that is, the counting-room. They are controlled
negatively and positively. We are discussing general characteristics
and have not space for detailed evidence. But one
or two cases will suffice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<p>An example of the coercion of the newspaper by the advertiser
was recently afforded by the Philadelphia press. The
Gimbel Brothers, owners of a department store, were charged
by United States Government officials with profiteering. The
only Philadelphia paper that made anything of the story was
the <cite>Press</cite>, which was owned by Mr. Wanamaker of the rival department
store. The other papers ignored the story or put it in
one edition and then withdrew it. If there is an elevator accident
in a general office building, it is reported. If there is a
similar accident in a department store, it is usually not reported.
When the New York <cite>Times</cite> (April 25, 1921) prints
a short account of the experience of four Wellesley college students
who disguised their intellectual superiority and got jobs
in department stores, the head-line tells us that they “Find
They Can Live on Earnings,” though the matter under the
head-line does not bear this out. Perhaps it does no harm to
suppress, or fail to publish, news of accidents and to make
out a good case for the living and working conditions of shop-girls.
These are minor matters in the news of the world and
their importance would appear only if they were accumulated
in their tediously voluminous mass.</p>

<p>The positive corruption of the newspaper by the advertiser
goes deeper and proceeds from larger economic powers than
individual merchants. There is all over the world a terrific
economic contest between the employing classes and the wage-earning
classes. The dramatic manifestation of this contest is
the strike. Almost invariably the news of a strike is, if not
falsified, so shaped as to be unfavourable to the workers. In
the New York <cite>Nation</cite> of January 5, 1921, Mr. Charles G.
Miller, formerly editor of the Cleveland <cite>Plain Dealer</cite>, exposes
the lies of the Pittsburgh papers during the steel strike. In
two weeks the Pittsburgh papers published more than thirty
pages of paid advertisements denouncing the leadership of the
strike and invoking “Americanism” against radicalism and
syndicalism. The news and editorial attitude of the papers
coincided with the advertisements and gave the impression that
the strikers were disloyal, un-American, bolshevik. They were
silent on the real questions at issue, hours, pay, working conditions.
And not only the Pittsburgh press but the press of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
the entire country was poisoned. For the Associated Press
and other news services are not independent organizations
feeding news to their clients but simply interrelated newspapers
swapping each other’s lies. The Denver newspapers
control all the news that is read in Boston about the Colorado
coal mines. The Boston newspapers control all the news that
is read in San Francisco about the New England textile mills.
The head of a local bureau of the Associated Press is not a
reporter; he is merely a more or less skilful compiler and
extracter who sends to the nation, to the whole world, matter
which is furnished him by the papers of his district. So that
he can usually hold up his hand and swear to the honesty of
his service; he is like an express agent who ships a case of
what he thinks is canned corn, and it is not his fault if there
is opium concealed in the case.</p>

<p>The power of the advertiser to make the newspaper servile
and right in its opinions is not confined to the local department
store or the special industry operating through a district
press. Nor is it confined to the negative punishment of withdrawing
advertising of commodities like hosiery, chewing gum,
and banking service from papers that offend their masters.
There is another method of exerting this power, and that is
to buy advertising space in which to set forth ideas calculated
to influence public opinion. Here is a full page from a New
York paper containing a cartoon and text, the main idea of
which is that Labour and Capital should pull together. It is
signed by “‘America First’ Publicity Association” and is
Bulletin No. 115 in a series—“be sure to read them all.”
This full-page bulletin, of which there have already been
more than a hundred, appeared in many newspapers—I do
not know how many; and a full page costs a good deal of
money. What is the object of this patriotic association? The
prevailing theme of the bulletins which I have seen is “Labour
be good! Fight Bolshevism! Beware the Agitator!” Who is
going to be influenced by these bulletins? Not the workingman.
He knows what he wants, and if he is the dupe of agitators
and false theories, these sermons can never rescue him.
Not the capitalist. He knows what he wants, and gets it.
Perhaps the little middle-class fellow may swallow such buncombe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
on his daily journey between his office and his home in
the suburbs. But he is already an intellectually depraved servant
of the employing classes, and it is not worth hundreds
of thousands of dollars to complete and confirm his corruption.
The primary object of the advertisement is to keep the newspaper
“good,” to encourage its editorial departments, through
the advertising department, not to fall below 99 and 44/100%
pure Americanism or admit ideas inimical to the general interests
of chambers of commerce, manufacturers’ associations,
and other custodians of the commonweal. I suspect that
some clever advertising man has stung the gentlemen who
supply the money for this campaign of education, but what is
a few million to them? The man who can best afford to laugh
is the business manager of the newspaper when he looks at the
check and meditates on the easy money of some of his advertising
clients and the easy credulity of some of his reading
clients.</p>

<p>It may be argued that the newspaper, which is a business,
ought to be controlled, directly and indirectly, by business interests;
and certainly if we allow the commercial powers to
manage our food supply, transportation, and housing, it is a
relatively minor matter if the same powers dominate our press.
In like manner if we tolerate dishonest governments, we are
only dealing with an epiphenomenon when we consider the
dishonest and inefficient treatment by the press of public affairs,
national and international. All the news of politics, diplomacy,
war, world-trade emanates from government officials
or from those who are interested in turning to their own advantage
the actions of officials. Business is behind government,
and government is behind business; which comes first
is unimportant like the problem of the chicken and the egg.
It is a partnership of swindle, and though the details of the
relation are infinitely complicated, the relation in itself is
easy to understand and accounts quite simply for the fact that
world news is the most viciously polluted of all the many
kinds of news. The efforts of a merchant to keep up the good
name of his department store, or of a group of manufacturers
to break a strike are feeble and even reasonable, so far as
they use the newspapers, compared to the audacious perversion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
of truth by the combination of arch criminals, government
and international business.</p>

<p>The star example in modern times is the current newspaper
history of Russia. The New York <cite>Nation</cite> of March 6, 1920,
published an article showing that in the columns of the New
York Times Lenin had died once, been almost killed three
times, and had fallen and fled innumerable times. The <cite>New
Republic</cite> published August 4, 1920, a supplement by Lippmann
and Merz summarizing the news which the <cite>Times</cite> printed
about Russia during the three years preceding March 1920.
The analysis shows an almost unbroken daily misrepresentation
of the programme, purposes and strength of the Russian
government and continuous false “optimism,” as the writers
gently call it, about the military exploits of Russia’s enemies,
the “white hopes,” Kolchak and Denekin. The writers expressly
state that they did not select the <cite>Times</cite> because it is
worse than other papers but, on the contrary, because it “is
one of the really great newspapers of the world.” “Rich” or
“powerful” would have been a better word than “great.”
The sources of error in the Times were the Associated Press,
the special correspondents of the Times, government officials
and political factions hostile to the present Russian régime.
Among the offenders was the United States Government or
the journalistic fake-factory in or adjacent to the Department
of State. At this writing the article in the <cite>New Republic</cite> has
been out nearly a year, that in the <cite>Nation</cite> more than a year.
It is fair to assume that they have been seen by the managers
of the <cite>Times</cite> and other powerful journalists, that if there was
any misstatement the weekly journals would have been forced
to recant, which they have not done, and that if the Ochses
of the newspaper world had any conscience they would have
been at least more careful after such devastating exposures.
But the game of “Lying about Lenin” goes merrily on.</p>

<p>The American government and the American press have not
been more mendacious in their treatment of Russia than the
governments and the press of other nations, but they have
been more persistently stupid and unteachable in the face of
facts. The British government has been engaged in an agile
zigzag retreat from its first position of no intercourse with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
Russia, and when the London <cite>Labour Herald</cite> exposed the trick
of Lloyd George which consisted of printing and sending out
<em>from Russia</em> propaganda against the Soviet government, the
prince of political liars was obliged to stop that fraud. On
the other hand one of the first acts of our new administration
was Mr. Hughes’s idiotic confirmation of the attitude held by
the old administration, and he furnished the newspapers real
news, since the Secretary’s opinions, however stupid, are real
news, to add to their previous accumulation of ignorance and
lies, and thereby encouraged them in their evil ways. If a
government is composed of noodles and rogues, the press
which reports the activities of the government and the opinions
of its officials is only secondarily responsible for deceiving the
public. The editors might be more critical in sifting the true
from the false. But the newspaper has no motive for trying
to correct the inherent vices of business and government; it
does not originate those vices but merely concurs in them and
reflects them. The newspaper is primarily responsible only
for the stupidity and mendacity of its correspondents and
editors. It is not an independent institution with its own ethic,
with either will or full opportunity to serve the truth, but is
only the symptom and expression of the vast corruption that
lies behind it and of the dense popular ignorance that stands
gaping before it.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="cy" lang="cy">Dunciad</i> of the Press does not end in quite universal
darkness. There is a little light over the horizon. A new
organization called The Federated Press, which endeavours to
“get the news in spite of the newspapers and the great news
agencies,” announces that already two hundred editors all over
the world are using its service. It is too soon to tell how successful
this enterprise will be, but it is a ray of promise, because
it is an association of working journalists and not a
vague aspiration of reformers and uplifters. Until some such
organization does become powerful and by practical labour
make an impression on the daily paper, we shall have to depend
for enlightenment on a few weekly and monthly periodicals
of relatively small circulation. Most of the popular
weeklies and monthlies are as bad in their way as the newspapers,
but they aim chiefly at entertainment; their treatment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
of the news in special articles and editorials is a subordinate
matter, and their chief sin is not dishonesty but banality. The
periodicals which do handle the news, always honestly, usually
with intelligence, the <cite>Nation</cite>, the <cite>New Republic</cite>, the <cite>Freeman</cite>
and one or two others, must have an influence greater than
can be measured by their circulation; for though the giant
press laughs at the cranky little Davids with their vicious
radical ideas, and though it is too strong to be slain or even
severely wounded, yet it cannot be quite insensible to the
stones that fly from those valorous slings. It is, however,
an indication of the low mental level of America that the combined
circulation of these journals, which are, moreover,
largely subscribed for by the same readers, is less than that of
a newspaper in a second-rate city. Two of them are endowed
or subsidized by liberal men of means and none of them is
shiningly prosperous. An intelligent populace would buy them
by the million. So we leave the responsibility where, after
all, it belongs. The American press is an accurate gauge of
the American mind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_LAW">THE LAW</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">“The</span> first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.” This
outcry of Jack Cade’s followers that the disappearance
of the whole profession was the initial step in man’s progress
toward a better world would be echoed in the United States
by the revolutionists of to-day, and also by not a few solid
business men who have nothing else in common with the mediæval
agitator except perhaps the desire to see the fountains
run wine and make it a felony to drink near-beer. Indeed
almost every one takes his fling at the law. Doctors and ministers
can be avoided if we dislike them, but the judge has a
sure grip upon us all. He drags us before him against our
will; no power in the land can overturn his decision, but defeated
litigants, disappointed sociologists, and unsuccessful
primary candidates all join in a prolonged yell, “Kill the umpire.”</p>

<p>Where there is smoke, there is fire. Underneath all this
agitation is a deep-seated suspicion and dissatisfaction aroused
by the legal profession and the whole machinery of justice.
It exists despite the fact observed by Bryce, that our system
of written constitutions has created a strongly marked legal
spirit in the people and accustomed them to look at all questions
in a legal way—a characteristic exemplified when other
peoples judged the Covenant of the League of Nations as an
expression of broad policies and the aspirations of a hundred
years, while we went at it word by word with a dissecting
knife and a microscope as if it had been a millionaire’s will
or an Income Tax Act. Moreover, although lawyers as a class
are unpopular, they are elected to half the seats in the legislatures
and in Congress. The profession which cannot boast
a single English Prime Minister in the century between Perceval
and Asquith, has trained every President who was not
a general, except Harding. Perhaps this very fact that lawyers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
receive public positions out of all proportion to their numbers
partially accounts for the prejudice felt against them by men
in other professions and occupations.</p>

<p>Hostility to lawyers and case-law is no new phenomenon in
this country. Puritans and Quakers arrived with unpleasant
memories of the English bench and bar, who had harried them
out of their homes. To them, law meant heresy trials,
and the impression that these left on the minds of their victims
has been set down forever by Bunyan in the prosecution of
Faithful at Vanity Fair. The Colonists were no more anxious
to transplant some Lord Hate-good, his counsellors, and his
law books to our shores, than Eugene V. Debs would strive
to set up injunctions and sedition statutes if he were founding
a socialistic commonwealth in the South Seas. The popular
attitude toward lawyers was re-inforced by the clergy who
were naturally reluctant to have their great moral and intellectual
influence disputed by men who would hire themselves
out to argue either side of any question. The ministers who
ruled Massachusetts and Connecticut by the Law of Moses,
wanted no rivals to challenge their decisions upon the authority
of Bracton and Coke. And everywhere, except perhaps
on the Southern plantations, the complicated structure of
feudal doctrines, which constituted such a large part of English
law well into the 18th century, was as unsuited to Colonial
ways and needs as a Gothic cathedral in the wilderness. Life
was so pressing, time was so short, labour so scarce, that the
only law which could receive acceptance must be so simple
that the settlers could apply it themselves. Although Justice
Story has spread wide the belief that our ancestors brought
the Common Law to New England on the <i>Mayflower</i>, the
truth is that only a few fragments got across. These were
rapidly supplemented by rules based on pioneer conditions.
Much the same phenomenon occurred as in the California of
1849, where the miners ignored the water-law of the Atlantic
seaboard which gave each person bordering on a stream some
share of the water, and adopted instead the custom better
suited to a new country of first come, first served. Almost
the earliest task of the founders of a Colony was the regulation
of the disputes which arise in a primitive civilization by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
brief legislative code concerning crimes, torts, and the simplest
contracts, in many ways like the dooms of the Anglo-Saxon
kings. Gaps in these codes were not filled from the Common
Law, as would be the case to-day, but by the discretion of the
magistrate, or in some Colonies, in the early days, from the
Bible. Land laws and conveyances were simple,—the underlying
English principle of primogeniture was abolished outright
by several Colonial charters, and disputes of title were
lessened by the admirable system of registering deeds. Such
law did not require lawyers, and it is not surprising that even
the magistrates were usually laymen. The chief justice of
Rhode Island as late as 1818 was a blacksmith. Oftentimes
a controversy was taken away from the court by the legislature
and settled by a special statute. Thus, instead of the
English and modern American judge-made law, the Colonists
received for the most part executive and legislative justice, and
lived under a protoplasmic popular law, with the Common Law
only one of its many ingredients.</p>

<p>The training of the few Colonists who did become lawyers
may be judged from that of an early attorney general of Rhode
Island:</p>

<p>“When he made up his mind to study law, he went into the
garden to exercise his talents in addressing the court and jury.
He then selected five cabbages in one row for judges, and
twelve in another row for jurors. After trying his hand there
a while, he went boldly into court and took upon himself the
duties of an advocate, and a little observation and experience
there convinced him that the same cabbages were in the court
house which he thought he had left in the garden,—five in one
row and twelve in another.”</p>

<p>The natural alienation of such attorneys from the intricacies
of English law was increased by occasional conflicts between
that system and Colonial statutes or conceptions of justice. An
excellent Connecticut act for the disposal of a decedent’s land
was declared void by the Privy Council in London as contrary
to the laws of England, and the attempt of the New York
governor and judges to enforce the obnoxious English law of
libel in the prosecution of Peter Zenger in order to throttle
the criticism of public officials by the press, would have succeeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
if the jury had not deliberately rejected the legal definitions
given by the court.</p>

<p>The Common Law became somewhat more popular when the
principles of individual rights which had blocked Stuart oppression
were used against George III. After the Revolution,
however, it suffered with all things English. Many lawyers
had been Loyalists. The commercial depression turned the
bar into debt collectors. The great decisions of Lord Mansfield
which laid the foundations of modern business law were
rejected by Jefferson and many other Americans because of
that judge’s reactionary policy towards the Colonies. Many
States actually passed legislation forbidding the use of English
cases as authorities in our courts. The enforcement of the
Common Law of sedition and criminal libel by judges, many
of whom had been educated in England, identified the Common
Law with the suppression of freedom of speech. Nevertheless,
the old simple Colonial rules were insufficient to decide
the complex commercial questions which were constantly arising,
especially in maritime transactions. Aid had to be obtained
from some mature system of law.</p>

<p>At this moment a rival to the Common Law presented itself
in the Napoleonic code of 1804, attractive to the populace
just because it was French, and to many of the bar because of
its logical arrangement and because unlike English lawyers
they were widely read in Roman and modern Continental law.
For a time it was actually doubtful whether the legal assistance
which American judges needed would be drawn from England
or France. French writers were cited in the courts and Livingston
drafted a code on the Napoleonic model for Louisiana.
The English law had, however, one great advantage. It was
written in our own language. Furthermore, a group of exceptionally
able judges such as Joseph Story and James Kent, by
their decisions and writings, virtually imported the great bulk
of the Common Law into this country and reworked it to meet
American conditions. Nevertheless, this law was something
that came from outside and had not grown up altogether from
the lives and thoughts of our own people, so that it has never
meant to Americans what English law means to Englishmen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
for whom it is as much a product of their own land as parliamentary
government or the plays of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Another reason for American hostility to law was found at
the frontier. The pioneer, imbued with the conviction that he
was entitled to the land which he had cleared, ploughed and
sown, often thrown by crop failures into debt to the tradesmen
in the town, resented law as something which was forced upon
him by people who led easy lives, who took his land away
for some technical defect of title, foreclosed mortgages, compelled
him to pay for goods of high prices and low quality,
suppressed hereditary feuds, and substituted a mass of book
learning which he was too ignorant or too busy to read, for
the simple principles of fair play which seemed sufficient to
him. Habitual obedience to law was a spirit which could not
develop in men who were largely squatters, and who, from
the outset of our national history, disregarded the Congressional
statutes which required that public lands must be surveyed
before they were settled. Sometimes, as in this instance,
the settler’s resistance to law was successful. More often they
were overpowered by the strength of civilization and submitted
to the law sullen and unconvinced.</p>

<p>The old frontier is gone, a new frontier has arisen. The
meeting place of unfriendly races has moved Eastward from
the Missouri to the Merrimac. The pioneers of to-day came
often from autocratic lands where law was something imposed
on them from above, and they were slow to regard our law
as different in kind. It was not a part of themselves. Moreover,
they did not find in America the energetic police organization
which had compelled their obedience in Europe. The
men who framed our system of laws were taught by Puritanism
that duties declared by those lawfully in authority
should be voluntarily performed. A statute once on the books
got much vitality from this spirit and from the social pressure
of the homogeneous settled communities, whatever the difficulties
of enforcement at the frontier. These forces behind law
became weaker when the population was split into numerous
and diverse races by the great tide of immigration. Obedience
to law, never automatic among us, now became liable to cease<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
altogether whenever a person thought the law unreasonable or
felt fairly certain that he would not be found out.</p>

<p>This belief that a law ceases to have obligation when it becomes
inexpedient to obey it, extends far beyond the recently
arrived elements in our population. For instance, a wealthy
man with several American generations behind him, who was
serving on the jury in an accident case, stood up on a chair
as soon as the jury got into the consultation-room and urged
them to disregard everything which the judge had instructed
them about the inability of the plaintiff to recover if he, as
well as the defendant, was negligent. “This doctrine of contributory
negligence,” said this educated juryman, “is not the
law of France or Germany or any country on the Continent of
Europe. A number of eminent writers agree that it is a thoroughly
bad law. Let’s have nothing to do with it.” Needless
to say, the plaintiff recovered. This conception of a higher
law than that on the books may owe something to the Abolitionists’
belief that they were not bound by the laws protecting
the inhuman institution of slavery. Many conscientious
persons still hold that a man ought not to be punished for disobeying
a law which he believes to be morally wrong. Fortunately,
a corrective to this dangerous doctrine of the inner
legal light is found in the words of a leading Abolitionist, Judge
Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar, in charging the Grand Jury on
riotous resistance to the fugitive slave law, although he himself
regarded it as vicious legislation:</p>

<p>“A man whose private conscience leads him to disobey a
law recognized by the community must take the consequences
of that disobedience. It is a matter solely between him and
his Maker. He should take good care that he is not mistaken,
that his private opinion does not result from passion or
prejudice, but, if he believes it to be his duty to disobey, he
must be prepared to abide by the result; and the laws as they
are enacted and settled by the constituted authorities to be
constitutional and valid, must be enforced, although it may be
to his grievous harm. It will not do for the public authorities
to recognize his private opinion as a justification of his
acts.”</p>

<p>Disrespect for law has been aggravated by the changing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
function of the lawyer since the Civil War. In the forties and
fifties, he stood out as a leader in his community, lifted by
education above the mass of citizens, often before the public
gaze in the court-room and chosen because of his forensic eloquence
to deliver many of those set orations which Americans
constantly demand, brought forward by the litigation of those
days as the avenger of crime, the defender of those unjustly
imprisoned, the liberator of the escaping slave, or upholding
some great public right on behalf of his city or State—the
construction of a toll-free bridge across the Charles, the maintenance
of the charter of Dartmouth College. After 1870,
this pre-eminence was challenged by the new captains of industry,
and their appearance was accompanied by an alteration
in the work of many an able lawyer, which soon obscured
him to the popular imagination. The formation of large businesses
required more and more the skill which he possessed.
Rewards for drafting and consultation became greater than
for litigation, which was growing tedious and costly, so that
his clients avoided it whenever possible. Consequently, he
changed from an advocate into a “client care-taker,” seldom
visible to the people and often associated in their minds with
the powerful and detested corporations which he represented.
Much of the prejudice against “corporation lawyers” was unjust,
and the business development of to-day would have been
impossible without the skill in organization and reorganization
of great enterprises which they displayed during the last half
century. However, popular opinion of a class is inevitably
based, not on all its members, but on a conspicuous few, and
the kind of legal career described in Winston Churchill’s “Far
Country” was common enough to furnish data for damaging
generalizations. In any case, the decline in the public influence
of the bar was inevitable, especially as certain businesses
retained the exclusive legal services of a staff of men,
so that it could be said: “Lawyers used to have clients; now,
clients have lawyers.”</p>

<p>Of course, during this period there were many lawyers who
made a notable success by conducting cases against corporations.
These accident lawyers were, however, no more popular
than their opponents, even with the workingmen whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
they represented. The small means of their clients made any
remuneration from them improbable unless damages were recovered.
Consequently, the lawyer agreed to take nothing if
defeated, but to even matters up insisted on a large fraction
of the amount awarded, usually one-third or even more, if he
won. Therefore, he fought not merely for justice and his
client, but for his own fee, and the temptation to win by
every possible means was great. Business men were quick to
label him unscrupulous, while workingmen resented it when
a large slice of the money which the jury gave to them as a
just measure for suffering a lifelong disability vanished into
some lawyer’s pockets.</p>

<p>No satisfactory substitute for the contingent fee was suggested,
but the prejudice created by the system and by the dislike
of corporation lawyers was too great to be dispelled by
the many members of the bar whose practice lay in neither
of these two fields. And indeed, the profession as a whole
cannot free itself from blame for some very definite evils, soon
to be discussed. Unfortunately, the long-standing antagonism
between lawyers and laymen has distracted the thoughts of
both sides from wrongs which ought to be and can be cured,
and turned them to never-ending disputes on problems of relatively
small importance. For instance, almost any layman
will open a discussion of the function of the lawyer by condemning
the profession because it defends criminals who are
known to be guilty. The solution of this problem is not easy,
but it is not worth a hundredth of the attention it receives, for
it hardly ever arises. The criminal law is a small part of the
whole law, and lawyers who have spent their whole lives in that
field have declared that they were not certain of the guilt of
a single client. A far more important problem is whether a
lawyer should advocate the passage of legislation which he
personally considers vicious. Indeed, the underlying question,
to which lawyers and laymen ought to be devoting themselves,
is this. How far can the State ascertain the proper
course of action by limiting itself to hearing paid representatives
of the persons directly interested, financially or otherwise;
or should the State also call in and pay trained men to
investigate the question independently? The solution of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
question will affect not only lawyers, but other professions as
well. Medical experts, for instance, might cease to be hired
by millionaires to prove them insane, or by the prosecuting
attorney with the opposite purpose, but might be employed by
the court to make an impartial inquiry into the mental condition
of a prisoner. In short, it may be that we have carried
the notion of litigation as a contest of wits between two sides
so far that the interests of society have not been adequately
safeguarded.</p>

<p>If laymen have erred in concentrating on minor points,
lawyers have been far too ready to deny laymen any right to
discuss law at all. It is just as if school-teachers should
maintain that parents and citizens in general have no concern
in the problems of education. The time has come to close
the gulf in American life between the legal profession and the
people who are ruled by laws. Law is the surface of contact
where the pressure of society bears upon the individual.
Doubtless, he attributes to the law many of the features in
this pressure to which he objects, whereas they actually result
from the social structure itself. The man who feels wronged
by a prosecution for bigamy, or for stealing bread when he is
starving for lack of employment, cannot expect to change the
law without also changing the views of the community on
monogamous marriage and the organization of industry.
These institutions of society show themselves in the law just
as the veins in a block of marble show themselves at the
surface, but it is as futile for him to blame the law for “capitalism,”
private property, or our present semi-permanent marriages
as to try to get rid of the veins by scraping the surface of
the marble. On the other hand, there are aspects of law which
do not correspond to any existing social requirements or demands,
and the layman has good cause to offer his opinion.
And it may be worth listening to. The onlooker often sees most
of the game. Although the layman may lack technical knowledge,
he can appreciate the relation of law to his own department
of human activity—business, social service, health—in
ways that are difficult for the lawyer who is absorbed in the
pressing tasks of each day. Moreover, the lawyer’s habitual
and necessary obligation to conform to existing laws naturally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
inclines him to overlook their defects, which are obvious to
those who can spend in detached criticism the same time which
he requires for practical application. Modern medicine was
created by Pasteur, who was not a doctor; modern English
law by Bentham, who was a lawyer to the extent of arguing
one case and who was edited by Mill, a philosopher and
economist.</p>

<p>Knowledge is no longer a matter of water-tight compartments.
“All good work is one,” says Wells in “Joan and
Peter.” Law touches psychology in its treatment of the defective
and insane, medicine and surgery in industrial accidents
and disease, political science in municipal corporations,
economics in taxation, philosophy in its selection of the purposes
it should strive to accomplish. And this is a meagre list.
The greatest need of American law is the establishment of
means for intelligent mutual understanding and effective co-operation,
not merely between lawyers and experts in such other
fields as those mentioned, but between lawyers and the mass of
our population, who fill the jails, pay the taxes, drink city
water, get hurt in factories, buy, sell, invest, build homes, and
leave it all to their children when they die.</p>

<p>For these men and women have a right to complain of our
law. Its evils are not those commonly decried, lawyers to defend
the guilty, reliance on precedents instead of common
sense, bribed judges. The real defect is failure to keep up to
date. Many existing legal rules have the same fault as New
York surface-cars before the subway or Hoboken Ferries
before the tubes. They were good in their day, but it has
gone by and they cannot handle the traffic. The system
formulated by Story and Kent worked well for the farms,
small factories, and small banks of their time, but the great
development of national resources and crowded cities presented
new situations unsuited to the old legal rules, and kept
men too busy for the constructive leisure necessary for thinking
out a new system. The law became a hand-to-mouth
affair, deciding each isolated problem as it arose, and often
deciding it wrong. Yet lawyers were satisfied with law, just
as business men with business. Then came the agitation of
the last fifteen years, which has at least made us discontented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
about many things. The next task is to stop calling each other
names, sit down together, think matters through to a finish,
and work together to complete the process which is farther
along than we realize, of making over the common law system
of an agricultural population a century ago to meet the needs
of the city-dwelling America of to-day.</p>

<p>A first step toward co-operation would be more discussion
of law in the press. Several years ago Charles E. Hughes in
a public address said that one reason why courts and lawyers
were so unpopular in this country was the unfamiliarity of the
people with what they were doing. Outside of criminal prosecutions,
divorces, and large constitutional cases, newspapers
give very little attention to legal questions, and even these
cases are presented fragmentarily with almost no attempt to
present their historical background and the general principles
at issue. There is nothing to compare with the resumé of
trials and decisions which appears from day to day in the London
<cite>Times</cite>, no popular exposition of legal problems such as
Woods Hutchinson has done for medicine or numerous writers
for the achievements of Einstein. Surely law can be made
as intelligible and interesting to the ordinary educated reader
as relativity. It enters so intimately into human relationships
that some knowledge of it is very important, not as a guide in
specific transactions as to which a lawyer ought to be consulted,
but as part of the mental stock-in-trade of the well-informed
citizen. Wider realization of the difficulties of the work of
judges and lawyers would bring about a friendlier and more
helpful popular attitude.</p>

<p>The public might understand, for example, why law does
not progress so conspicuously and rapidly as medicine or engineering.
Part of the blame rests, no doubt, upon lawyers,
who have been less active than other professions in discussing
and applying new ideas, but the very nature of the subject is
an obstacle to quick change. In law, progress requires group
action; the individual can accomplish little. The physician
who discovers a new antitoxin, the surgeon who invents a new
method of operating for gastric ulcer, can always, if his reputation
be established, find some patient upon whom to test his
conception. Its excellence or its faults can be rapidly proved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
to his own mind and that of any skilled onlooker. And new
ideas, if sound, mean a larger practice and money in his pocket.
The lawyer gets no such rewards for improving the law, and
has no such opportunities for experiment. If he is convinced
by observation, wide reading, and long thinking, that arrest
for debt should be abolished, or the property of a spendthrift
protected by law from his creditors, or trial by jury abandoned
except in criminal trials, he cannot try out these theories upon
some client. He must sacrifice days from his regular work to
persuade a whole legislature to test his idea upon thousands
of citizens, and if the idea is a bad one, the experiment will
be a widespread disaster. Consequently law reform always
faces an instinctive and discouraging legislative opposition.
Even after every State except two had adopted the Uniform
Negotiable Instruments Law, the Georgia legislature refused
to do so because the Act abolished days of grace, the old custom
allowing a debtor three days beyond the time of payment
named in his note. They said that when a man had promised
to pay a debt on May 1, it was un-American not to let him
wait till May 4. Again, a committee of very able New York
lawyers recently drew a short Practice Act setting forth the
main requirements for the conduct of a law-suit, and leaving
the details to the judges, who may be supposed to know more
about their own work than the legislature. Similar laws have
long been in successful operation in England, Massachusetts,
and Connecticut, whereas the existing New York Code of
Civil Procedure with its thousands of sections has been a
vexatious source of delay and disputes in the press of urban
litigation. The new measure was an admirable and thorough
piece of work, endorsed by the Bar Associations of New York
City and the State. Yet it was killed by the age-long opposition
of the country to the town. Upstate lawyers, less harassed
by the old Code because of uncrowded rural dockets,
objected to throwing over their knowledge of the existing system
and spending time to learn a new and better one. The
legislature hated to give more power to the courts. As a result,
the new bill was scrapped, and nothing has been done
after years of agitation except to renumber the sections of
the old Code with a few improvements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<p>Another factor in law reform is the existence of fifty legal
systems in one nation. Even if the law is modernized in one
State, the objectionable old rule will remain in the other forty-seven
until their legislatures are persuaded by the same tedious
process. On the other hand, this diversity has its merits.
Some of the progressive Western States serve as experiment
stations for testing new legal and governmental schemes. Still
more important, the limitations on legal experimentation are
somewhat offset by the opportunities for observation of the
workings of different legal rules in neighbouring States. The
possibilities of this comparative method for judging the best
solution of a legal problem have not yet been fully utilized.
For example, a dispute has long raged whether it is desirable
to compel a doctor to disclose professional secrets on the witness-stand
without the patient’s consent. About half the
States require him to keep silent. The reasons given are,
that patients will seek medical aid less freely if their confidences
may be disclosed; doctors would lie to shield their
patients; some doctors are hired by employers to treat workmen
injured in accidents and will try to get evidence on behalf
of the employers if they are allowed to testify. So far,
the discussion has turned on the probability or improbability
that these arguments represent the facts, and neither side has
collected the facts. The discussion could be brought down to
earth by an investigation in New York which has the privilege,
and Massachusetts, where secrecy is not maintained. Are
doctors less consulted in Massachusetts, do they perjure themselves,
do they ingratiate themselves with workmen to defeat
subsequent accident suits? Statistics, personal interviews
with judges and physicians, and examination of the stenographic
records of trials ought to give valuable assistance in determining
which half of the States has the better rule.</p>

<p>Since law reform requires highly organized group action,
some individual should be charged with the responsibility of
organization. At present, it is everybody’s business. Judges
are hearing cases all day and writing opinions at night, and
they have no legislative position as in England, where they can
draft bills and present them in the House of Lords. Individual
lawyers carry little weight. The Bar Associations have accomplished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
much, but the work of their members is done without
pay in the intervals of practice, and they have no official
standing. The Attorney General is necessarily a partisan, representing
the State’s side in litigation, with neither the time
nor the duty to improve the law in general. The United
States and the larger States badly need a Minister of Justice.
All complaints of legal inefficiency would come to him, and he
would be constantly collecting statistics of the cases in the
courts and their social consequences, observing procedure personally,
or through a corps of expert assistants, conferring with
the judges and the Bar Associations, drafting or examining
measures affecting the administration of justice and giving
his opinion about them to the legislature, and charged with
the general duty of ascertaining whether every person can find
a certain remedy from the laws for all injuries or wrongs, obtaining
right and justice freely and without purchase, completely
and without denial, promptly and without delay.</p>

<p>Until we establish such an official, we can rely on three instruments
of legal advance, each of which may be a point of co-operation
between lawyers and laymen. Of the first, the Bar
Associations, something has already been said. The second
is the judiciary. Unfortunately, the tendency of the American
antagonism to law to concentrate on personal topics has
warped the prolonged discussion of this branch of our government
during the last ten years, and, indeed, since 1789.
Charges of corruption and incompetency against individual
judges, and methods of getting a bad judge off the bench, have
entirely obscured the problem of getting good judges on the
bench. The power of judges to declare statutes unconstitutional
and void makes them the controlling factor in our government,
yet there is no country where less attention is paid
to their selection and training. It is of no use to recall a poor
judge by popular vote if the people are eager to put one of
the same type in his place. Nothing need be added to the
estimate in Bryce’s “Modern Democracies” of the unevenness
of judicial personnel. The most obvious need, if the inferior
judges are to be brought up to the level of the best men,
is for higher salaries. But that alone is not enough to induce
leaders of the bar to become judges. No salary could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
so high as the income of successful metropolitan lawyers.
The time has come for greater willingness on their part
to retire from a large practice in middle life and devote
their talents to judicial work. And even this will be useless,
unless selection is based on merit. Our system of an elective
judiciary is probably too deeply rooted to be entirely abandoned,
though it is clear that legal talent is not a quality, like
executive ability, readily capable of being appraised by the
electorate. On the other hand, it is not altogether certain that
State governors would appoint judges without regard to partisan
considerations. An interesting compromise plan has
been suggested, that there should be a Chief Justice, elected
by the people, who should be in effect the Minister of Justice
already described. All the other judges would be appointed
by him, for life or for long terms, while his responsibility for
wise selections would be secured by a short term or even by
the recall. A governor does so many tasks that his judicial
appointments do not play a large part in the popular judgment
of his record, but the Chief Justice would stand or fall on the
merits of the administration of law under his management.</p>

<p>Moreover, we do not deal fairly by the judges chosen under
existing systems. After they have been selected, they should
have more opportunity to study the special duties of their position
before beginning work, and more leisure amid trials and
opinions for general legal reading and for observation of the
complexities of modern life which are inevitably involved in
their decisions, especially on constitutional questions. Most
litigation grows out of urban and industrial conditions, with
which State supreme court judges may easily get out of touch,
if they remain continuously in the State House in a small
upstate city like Springfield, Albany, or Sacramento, with little
opportunity to visit the factories and tenements of Chicago,
New York, and San Francisco. It may also be doubted
whether our usual system which restricts some judges to trials
and others to appellate work is wise; an occasional change
from one to the other is both refreshing and instructive.
Judges frequently complain of the monotony of their work,
cooped up with a few associates of similar mental interests, so
that the atmosphere may acquire the irritability of a boarding-house.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
It is not generally understood how much judges are
cut off from other men. Close intimacy with their former
friends at the bar or with wealthy business men who may have
cases before them, is sure to cause talk. Graham Wallas’s
suggestion of an occasional transfer to active work of a semi-judicial
character, like Judge Sankey’s chairmanship of the
English Coal Commission, seems valuable. Our Interstate
Commerce Commission would provide such an opportunity.
Finally, the existing gulf between courts and law schools might
be narrowed by summer conferences on growing-points in
the law, where each side could give much out of its experience
to the other.</p>

<p>The remaining instrument of progress is the law schools.
“Legal education,” says Bryce, “is probably nowhere so thorough
as in the United States.” The chief reasons for this success
are two, the professional law teacher, who has replaced
the retired judge and the practising lawyer who lectured in
his spare hours; and the case-system of instruction. This
method is not, as is popularly believed, the memorization by
the students of the facts of innumerable cases. It imparts
legal principles, not on the say-so of a text-book or a professor,
but by study and discussion of the actual sources of
those principles, the decisions of the courts. The same method
in the Continental Law would result in a class-room discussion
of codes and commentators, which are there the sources.
One of the most interesting signs of its success is its spread
from law into other sciences such as medicine. Books based
on the study of concrete situations are used in public schools
for the study of geography and hygiene, and charitable societies
work out the general needs of the community from the problems
of individual families. This system has superseded in
all the leading law schools the old methods of lecturing and
reading treatises. Its most conspicuous service is, of course,
vocational, the training of men whose advice a client can safely
accept. Already some States have required a law-school degree
as a condition of admission to the bar, and the old haphazard
law-office apprenticeship will eventually disappear, although
the question of how far a man who is earning his living should
be allowed to study law in his spare hours at a night law school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
whose standards must usually be lower than a full-time school
remains as a difficult problem in a democratic country. Efficiency
of training conflicts with equality of opportunity. A
second service of the leading law schools is the modernization
of the law through the production of books. A great example
of this is the “Treatise on Evidence,” by John H. Wigmore,
dean of Northwestern Law School, which is every day
influencing courts and renovating the most antiquated portion
of the common law.</p>

<p>Of late years, the need for fresh changes in method has become
plain. Christopher Columbus Langdell, the inventor of
the case-system, laid down two fundamental propositions:
“First, that law is a science; second, that all the available
materials of that science are contained in printed books.” Experience
has proved that he was right in believing that attendance
in a lawyer’s office or at the proceedings of courts was
not essential to a legal education. But the scope of legal
study must now extend beyond printed books, certainly beyond
law books. Since law is not an isolated department of knowledge,
but a system of rules for the regulation of human life,
the truth of those rules must be tested by many facts outside
the past proceedings of courts and legislatures. Not only
law in books but law in action has to be considered, and after
learning the principles evolved by a process of inclusion and
exclusion in the decisions or by intermittent legislative action,
the scholar must find how those principles actually work in
the bank, the factory, the street, and the jail. The problem
is still debated, whether this can better be done in the pre-legal
college course or by the use of non-legal experts in the
law schools, or whether the necessary material should be
assimilated and presented by the law teachers themselves. Yet
this widening of the content of legal study does not in the least
impair the validity of Langdell’s method, the systematic investigation
of the sources of law at first hand, whether those
sources be found in the reports and statutes which he had in
mind, or in the economic, social, and psychological facts which
have demanded attention in recent years.</p>

<p>Something must be said in closing of those portions of the
law where change has been most necessary. Of these our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
criminal law is easily the most disgraceful. Its complete inability
to perform its task has been exhaustively demonstrated
by the opening chapter of Raymond Fosdick’s “American
Police Systems.” The lawyers and judges are only partly
to blame, for their work forms only the middle of three stages
in the suppression of crime. The initial stage of arrest and
the final stage of punishment are in the hands of administrative
officials, beyond the control of the bench and bar. Many
criminals are never caught, and the loss of public confidence
in the justice or effectiveness of prisons makes juries reluctant
to convict. Yet the legal profession is sorely at fault for
what takes place while the prisoner is in the dock. The whole
problem calls for that co-operation between lawyers, other
experts, and laymen, of which I have already spoken. Unless
something is soon done, we may find crime ceasing to be
a legal matter at all. Even now, many large department stores
have so little belief in the criminal courts and prisons that
they are trying embezzlers and shoplifters in tribunals of
their own, and administering a private system of probation
and restitution. The initial step is a reformulation of the purpose
of punishment. Twenty-five years ago, Justice Holmes
asked, “What have we better than a blind guess to show that
the criminal law in its present form does more good than
harm?”</p>

<p>One serious reason for its breakdown has been the creation
of innumerable minor offences, which are repeatedly committed
and almost impossible to suppress. The police are diverted
from murders and burglaries to gambling and sexual delinquencies,
while the frequent winking at such breaches of law
destroys the essential popular conviction that a law ought to
be obeyed just because it is law. The Chief of Police of New
Orleans told Raymond Fosdick, “If I should enforce the law
against selling tobacco on Sunday, I would be run out of office
in twenty-four hours. But I am in constant danger of being
run out of office because I don’t enforce it.” So they were
hanging green curtains, which served the double purpose of
advertising the location of the stands and of protecting the
virtue of the citizens from visions of evil.</p>

<p>At the present time we have thrown a new strain on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
criminal law by the enactment of nation-wide prohibition. The
future will show whether the main effect of this measure will
be an increase in disrespect and antagonism for law, or the
ultimate removal of one of the chief causes of lawlessness
and waste. Unfortunately, the perpetual discussion of home-brew
receipts and hidden sources of supply has prevented a
general realization that we are witnessing one of the most far-reaching
legislative experiments of all time. What we ought
to be talking about is the consequences of prohibition to health,
poverty, crime, earning-power, and general happiness. It is
possible, for instance, that total abstinence for the working
classes coupled with apparently unlimited supplies of liquor
for their employers may have the double consequence of increasing
the resentful desire of the former to wrest the control
of wealth from those who are monopolizing a time-honoured
source of pleasure, and of weakening the ability of
the heavy-drinking sons of our captains of industry to stand
up in the struggle against the sober brains of the labour leaders
of the future. Prohibition may thus bring about a striking
shift of economic power.</p>

<p>The delays, expense, and intricacies of legal procedure demand
reform. The possession of a legal right is worthless to
a poor man if he cannot afford to enforce it through the courts.
The means of removing such obstacles have been set forth by
Reginald H. Smith in “Justice and the Poor.” For instance,
much has already been accomplished by Small Claims Courts,
where relief is given without lawyers in a very simple manner.
When a Cleveland landlady was sued by a boarder because she
had detained his trunk, she told the judge that he had set fire
to his mattress while smoking in bed and refused to pay her
twenty-five dollars for the damage. The judge, instead of
calling expert witnesses to prove the value of the mattress,
telephoned the nearest department store, found he could buy
another for eight dollars, and the parties agreed to settle on
that basis. Again, family troubles are now scattered through
numerous courts. A father deserts, and the mother goes to
work. The neglected children get into the Juvenile Court.
She asks for a separation in the Probate Court. A grocer sues
her husband for food she has bought, before a jury. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
prosecutes him before a criminal court for non-support, and
finally secures a divorce in equity. One Court of Domestic
Relations should handle all the difficulties of the family, which
ought to be considered together. Much of the injustice to
the poor has been lessened by legal aid societies, which have
not only conducted litigation for individuals but have also
fought test-cases up to the highest courts, and drafted statutes
in order to protect large groups of victims of injustice. The
injury done to the poor by antiquated legal machinery is receiving
wide attention, but it is also a tax on large business
transactions which is ultimately paid by the consumer. Reform
is needed to secure justice to the rich.</p>

<p>The substantive law which determines the scope of rights
and duties has been more completely overhauled, and many
great improvements have been accomplished. Relations between
the public and the great corporations which furnish
transportation and other essential services are no longer left
to the arbitrary decisions of corporate officers or the slow
process of isolated litigation. Public service commissions do
not yet operate perfectly, but any one who doubts their desirability
should read a contemporary Commission Report and
then turn to the history of the Erie Railroad under Jim Fiske
and Jay Gould as related in “The Book of Daniel Drew.”
The old fellow-servant rule which threw the burden of an industrial
accident upon the victim has been changed by workmen’s
compensation acts which place the risk upon the employer.
He pays for the injured workman as for a broken
machine and shifts the expense to his customers as part of
the costs of the business. The burden is distributed through
society and litigation is rapid and inexpensive. Unfortunately,
no such satisfactory solution has been reached in the law of
labour organizations, but its chaotic condition only corresponds
to the general American uncertainty on the proper treatment
of such organizations. It is possible that just as the King,
in the Middle Ages, insisted on dragging the Barons into his
courts to fight out their boundary disputes there, instead of
with swords and battleaxes on the highway, so society which
is the victim of every great industrial dispute will force employers
and workmen alike to settle their differences before a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
tribunal while production goes on. The Australian Courts of
Conciliation have lately been imitated in Kansas, an experiment
which will be watched with close interest.</p>

<p>Less importance must be attached, however, to the development
of particular branches of the law than to the change
in legal attitude. The difference between the old and the new
is exemplified by two extracts from judicial decisions which
were almost contemporaneous. Judge Werner, in holding the
first New York Workmen’s Compensation Act unconstitutional,
limited the scope of law as follows:</p>

<p>“This quoted summary of the report of the commission to
the legislature, which clearly and fairly epitomizes what is
more fully set forth in the body of the report, is based upon
a most voluminous array of statistical tables, extracts from
the works of philosophical writers and the industrial laws of
many countries, all of which are designed to show that our
own system of dealing with industrial accidents is economically,
morally, and legally unsound. Under our form of government,
however, courts must regard all economical, philosophical
and moral theories, attractive and desirable though
they may be, as subordinate to the primary question whether
they can be moulded into statutes without infringing upon
the letter or spirit of our written constitutions.... With
these considerations in mind we turn to the purely legal phases
of the controversy.” (Ives <i>v.</i> South Buffalo Ry. Co., 201 N. Y.
271, 287, 1911.)</p>

<p>A different attitude was shown by the Supreme Court of the
United States in its reception of the brief filed by Mr. Louis
D. Brandeis on behalf of the constitutionality of an Oregon
statute limiting woman’s work to ten hours a day. Besides
decisions, he included the legislation of many States and of
European countries. Then follow extracts from over ninety
reports of committees, bureaus of statistics, commissioners of
hygiene, inspectors of factories, both in this country and in
Europe, to the effect that long hours of labour are dangerous
for women, primarily because of their special physical organization.
Following them are extracts from similar reports discussing
the general benefits of shorter hours from the economic
aspect of the question. Justice Brewer said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

<p>“The legislation and opinions referred to in the margin may
not be, technically speaking, authorities, and in them is little
or no discussion of the constitutional question presented to us
for determination, yet they are significant of a widespread
belief that woman’s physical structure, and the functions she
performs in consequence thereof, justify special legislation restricting
or qualifying the conditions under which she should be
permitted to toil. Constitutional questions, it is true, are not
settled by even a consensus of present public opinion, for it is
a peculiar value of a written constitution that it places in unchanging
form limitations upon legislative action, and thus
gives a permanence and stability to popular government which
otherwise would be lacking. At the same time, when a question
of fact is debated and debatable, and the extent to which
a special constitutional limitation goes is affected by the truth
in respect to that fact, a widespread and long continued belief
concerning it is worthy of consideration. We take judicial
cognizance of all matters of general knowledge.” (Muller <i>v.</i>
Oregon, 208 U. S. 412, 420, 1907.)</p>

<p>The decision displays two qualities which are characteristic
of the winning counsel since his elevation to the bench; it
keeps its eye on the object instead of devoting itself to abstract
conceptions, and it emphasizes the interest of society in new
forms of protection against poverty, disease, and other evils.
To these social interests, the property of the individual must
often be partly sacrificed and in recent years we have seen the
courts upholding the guarantee of bank deposits, State regulation
of insurance rates, and suspension of the right of landlords
to recover unreasonable rents or dispossess their tenants.
All this would have been regarded as impossible fifty years
ago.</p>

<p>These extensions of governmental power over property have
been accompanied by legislation severely restricting freedom
of discussion of still more radical types of State control. It is
argued that the right of free speech must face limitation like
the right of the landlord. The true policy is exactly the opposite.
Not only is it unjust for the State to carry out one form
of confiscation while severely punishing the discussion of another
form, but in an age of new social devices the widest liberty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
for the expression of opinion is essential, so that the
merits and demerits of any proposed plan may be thoroughly
known and comparisons made between it and alternative
schemes, no matter how radical these alternatives may be. A
body of law that was determined to stand still might discourage
thought with no serious damage; but law which is determined
to move needs the utmost possible light so that it may be sure
of moving forward.</p>

<p>No one has expressed so well the new importance of social
interests, and the value of freedom of speech; no one, indeed,
has expressed so nobly the task and hopes of American Law,
as the man of whom it is said that among the long list of
American judges, he seems “the only one who has framed for
himself a system of legal ideas and general truths of life, and
composed his opinions in harmony with the system already
framed.” (John H. Wigmore, “Justice Holmes and the Law
of Torts,” 29 Harv. L. Rev. 601.) Yet no one has been more
cautious than Justice Holmes in warning us not to expect too
much from law.</p>

<p>“The law, so far as it depends on learning, is indeed, as it
has been called, the government of the living by the dead. It
cannot be helped, it is as it should be, that the law is behind
the times. As law embodies beliefs that have triumphed in
the battle of ideas and then have translated themselves into
action, while there is still doubt, while opposite convictions still
keep a battle front against each other, the time for law has
not come; the notion destined to prevail is not yet entitled to
the field.” (“Collected Legal Papers,” 138, 294.)</p>

<p>It is the work of the present generation of American lawyers
to be sure that the right side wins in the many conflicts now
waging. We cannot be certain that the law will make itself rational,
while we remain as inactive as in the past, absorbed in
our own routine, and occasionally pausing to say, “All’s right
with the world”; for, to quote Holmes once more, “The mode
in which the inevitable comes to pass is through effort.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">If</span> Henry Adams had lived in the 13th century he would have
found the centre of a world of unity in the most powerful
doctrine of the church, the cult of the Virgin Mary. Living
in the 19th century he sums up his experience in a world of
multiplicity as the attempt to realize for himself the saving
faith of that world in what is called education. Adams was
not the first to be struck with the similarity of the faiths of
the mediæval and the modern world. This comparison is the
subject of an article by Professor Barrett Wendell published
in the <cite>North American Review</cite> for 1904 and entitled “The
Great American Superstition”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Undefined and indefinite as it is, the word education is
just now a magic one; from the Atlantic to the Pacific, it is
the most potent with which you can conjure money out of
public chests or private pockets. Let social troubles declare
themselves anywhere, lynchings, strikes, trusts, immigration,
racial controversies, whatever you chance to hold most threatening,
and we are gravely assured on every side that education
is the only thing which can preserve our coming generations
from destruction. What is more, as a people we listen
credulously to these assurances. We are told, and we believe
and evince magnificent faith in our belief, that our national
salvation must depend on education.”</p>
</div>

<p>Professor Wendell goes on trenchantly to compare this reigning
modern faith with that in the mediæval church. He calls
attention to the fact that whereas the dominant architectural
monuments of the Old World are great cathedrals and religious
houses, implying the faith that salvation could be assured
by unstinted gifts to the church, in our modern times the most
stately and impressive structures are our schools, colleges, and
public libraries, many of them, like the cathedrals, erected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
by sinners of wealth in the pursuit of individual atonement
and social salvation. “Ask any American what we shall do
to be saved, and if he speak his mind he will probably bid
us educate our fellow-men.” He might have extended his
comparison to the personal hierarchy of the two institutions,
for at the time of his article the President of Harvard spoke
to the people of the United States with the voice of Innocent
III, surrounded by his advisers among university presidents
and superintendents gathered like Cardinal Archbishops,
in the conclave of the National Education Association, of which
the Committee of Ten was a sort of papal curia. Although
the educational papacy has fallen into schism, the cities are
still ruled by superintendents like bishops, the colleges by
president and deans, like abbots and priors, and the whole
structure rests on a vast population of teachers holding their
precarious livings like the parish priests at the will of their
superiors, tempered by public opinion. Indeed, Professor
Wendell is struck by the probability that as European society
was encumbered by the itinerant friars, so America will have
“its mendicant orders of scholars—the male and female doctors
of philosophy.” But it is his main theme which concerns
us here, that “the present mood of our country concerning
education is neither more nor less than a mood of blind,
mediæval superstition.”</p>

<p>The difference between faith as religion and as superstition
may be hard to define, the terms having become somewhat interchangeable
through controversy, but in general we should
doubtless use the pragmatic test. A vital and saving faith
which actually justifies itself by results is religion; a faith
which is without constructive effect on character and society,
and is merely fanciful, fantastic, or degrading we call superstition.
The old education which America brought from
England and inherited from the Renaissance was a reasonable
faith. It consisted of mathematics, classics, and theology, and
while it produced, except in rare instances, no mathematicians,
classical scholars, or theologians, it trained minds for the
learned professions of those days and it gave the possessors
of it intellectual distinction, and admitted them to the society<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
of cultivated men everywhere. Its authority was largely traditional,
but it worked in the world of that day much as the
thirty-three Masonic degrees do in the world of Masonry. It
may properly be called a religion, and in its rigid, prescribed,
dogmatic creed it may be compared to the mediæval theology.
At any rate, it suffered the same fate and from the same cause.
Its system was too narrow for the expanding knowledge and
the multiplying phenomena of the advancing hour. It failed
to take account of too many things. The authority of tradition,
by which it maintained its position, was challenged and
overthrown, and private judgment was set in its place.</p>

<p>Private judgment in education is represented by the elective
system; President Eliot was the Luther of this movement
and Harvard College his Wittenberg. Exactly as after the
Reformation, however, the attitudes of assertion and subservience
in spiritual matters continued to manifest themselves
where the pope had been deposed, in Geneva and Dort and
Westminster, so in spite of the anarchy of the elective system
the educational function continues to impose itself in its traditional
robes of authority, and to be received with the reverence
due to long custom. And in this way education in
America from being a saving faith has become an illusion.
The old education, its authority challenged, its sway limited,
and nobody caring whether its followers can quote Latin or
not, is in the position of the Church of Rome; the so-called
new education, uncertain in regard to material and method,
direction and destination, is like the anarchic Protestant sects.
Neither possesses authority; the old system has lost it, and
the new ones have never had it. They are alike in depending
upon the blindness of the masses which is superstition.</p>

<p>Although the generalization remains true that the mood of
America toward education is a mood of superstition, there are
certain forms of education operative in America to-day which
approve themselves by performance and justify the reasonable
faith in which they are held. The argument in favour of the
elective system, by force of which it displaced the prescribed
classical course, was that it was necessary to give opportunity
for specialization. This opportunity it has given, and in certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
directions the results produced by American institutions
are of high value. Our scientific education is the most advanced,
and in the professions which depend upon it, engineering
and medicine, our product doubtless “compares favourably”
with that of Europe. These facts cannot be cited,
however, as a valid reason for the American faith in education
as a whole. It is recognized to-day that progress in
natural science has far outrun that in politics, social life, culture—therein
lies the tragedy of the world. A few men of
science have a knowledge of the means by which the human
race can be destroyed in a brief space—and no statesmen,
philosophers, or apostles of culture have the power to persuade
the human race not to permit it to be done.</p>

<p>In another direction a great increase of specialization has
taken place—in the preparation for business. Our colleges
of business administration rival our scientific schools in the
exactness of their aim, and the precision of their effort. Here
again, however, it may be questioned whether their success
is one to justify belief in the educational process as a whole.
The result of such specialization upon the business organization
of society can hardly be to arouse a critical, and hence
truly constructive, attitude in regard to the whole economic
problem; it is nearly certain to promote a disposition to take
advantage of the manifest shortcomings of that organization
for individual successful achievement. Whether society as a
whole will profit by the efforts of such experts as our business
colleges are turning out remains to be seen. Whether we are
wise in strengthening the predatory elements which put a strain
on the social organization, at a time when the whole structure
is trembling, is open to question. Here again the faith of
America in education as social salvation is not justified by individual
results, however brilliant and fortunate.</p>

<p>The value of the specialist to society is unquestionable,
but he alone will not save it. Such salvation must come from
the diffusion and validity of the educational process as a whole,
from the men and women of active intelligence, broad view,
wide sympathy, and resolute character who are fitted as a
result of it to see life steadily and see it whole, reason soundly
to firm conclusions in regard to it, and hold those decisions in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
the face of death. The specialist indeed may be considered
a necessary subtraction from the general social army, a person
set apart for special duty, whose energies are concentrated and
loyalties narrowed. We expect him to die, if need be, in maintaining
that the world moves, but not for freedom of thought
in the abstract. It is by the generally trained, all-round product
of our education that the system must be judged. And
what do we find?</p>

<p>The general student, it appears, tends to be the product of
as narrow a process as the specialist, but not as deep. As the
demands of specialization become more exacting, its requirements
reach farther and farther back into the field of general
education, and more and more of the area is restricted to its
uses. The general student in consequence becomes a specialist
in what is left over. Moreover, he exercises his right of private
judgment and free election along the path of least resistance.
Laboratory science he abhors as belonging to a course
of specialization which he has renounced. The classics and
mathematics, to which a good share of our educational machinery
is still by hereditary right devoted, he scorns as having
no <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">raison d’être</i> except an outworn tradition. With the
decline of the classics has gone the preliminary training for
modern languages, which the general student usually finds
too exacting and burdensome, and from the obligation of which
colleges and secondary institutions also are now rapidly relieving
him. We boasted in the late war that we had no quarrel
with the German language, and yet by our behaviour we recognized
that one of the fruits of victory was the annihilation of
at least one foreign speech within our borders. The general
student is thus confined, by right of private judgment of
course, to his own language and literature, and such superficial
studies in history and social science as he can accomplish
with that instrument alone. His view is therefore narrow and
insular. His penetration is slight. He is, in short, a specialist
in the obvious.</p>

<p>Not only does the general student tend to be as restricted
in subject-matter as the specialist, but he lacks the training
in investigation, reasoning, and concentration which the latter’s
responsibility for independent research imposes. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
definition of the aim of general education on which Professor
Wendell rested his case for the old curriculum in the article
quoted above, is “such training as shall enable a man to
devote his faculties intently to matters which of themselves
do not interest him.” Now clearly if the student persistently
chooses only the subjects which interest him, and follows them
only as far as his interest extends, he escapes all training
in voluntary attention and concentration. In his natural disposition
to avoid mental work he finds ready accomplices in
his instructors and text-book writers. They realize that they
are on trial, and that interest alone is the basis of the verdict.
Accordingly they cheerfully assume the burden of preliminary
digestion of material, leaving to the student the assimilation
of so much as his queasy stomach can bear. One way in
which the study of English literature or history can be made
a matter of training in criticism and reasoning is to send the
student to the sources, the original material, and hold him
responsible for his conclusions. He may gain a wrong or inadequate
view, but at any rate it is his own, and it affords him
a solid basis for enlargement or correction. Instead of this
the student is invited to a set of criticisms and summaries
already made, and is usually discouraged if by chance he
attempts a verification on his own account. The actual reading
of Shakespeare, Bacon, Milton, Swift, Burke will give the
student at least a certain training in concentration; but this
is hard, slow, and dry work. It is much easier and more comprehensive,
instead of reading one play of Shakespeare, to
read <em>about</em> all the plays, including the life of the author, his
dramatic art, and some speculations in regard to the Elizabethan
stage. It was William James who pointed out the
difference between <em>knowledge about</em> and <em>acquaintance with</em> an
author. The extent to which we have substituted for the
direct vision, with its stimulating appeal to individual reaction,
the conventional summary and accepted criticism, the official
formula and the stereotyped view, is the chief reason for the
ready-made uniformity of our educated product.</p>

<p>The pioneer democracy of America itself is responsible for
a method of instruction typically American. The superstitious
faith in education was the basis of a system whereby many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
busy, middle-aged persons whose early advantages had been
limited, by means of attractive summaries, outlines, and handbooks,
could acquaint themselves with the names of men,
books, and events which form the Binet-Simon test of culture,
and enable the initiate to hold up his head in circles where
the best that has been thought or said in the world is habitually
referred to. This method is carried out in hundreds of
cultural camp-meetings every summer, by thousands of popular
lectures, in countless programmes of study for women’s
clubs. Unfortunately it is coming to be not only the typical
but the only method of general education in America. Chautauqua
has penetrated the college and the university. Better
that our fathers had died, their intellectual thirst unsatisfied,
than that they had left this legacy of mental soft drinks for
their children.</p>

<p>Thus far I have had the college chiefly in mind, but the
same observations apply equally to the secondary school. The
elective system has made its way thither, and indeed one of
the chief difficulties of organizing a college curriculum for the
general student which shall represent something in the way
of finding things out, of reasoning from facts to conclusions,
and of training in voluntary attention, is that of determining
any common ground on the basis of previous attainment. Not
only the elective system but the Chautauqua method has largely
permeated our high schools. The teachers, often on annual
appointment, more than the college instructors, with comparative
security of tenure, are dependent on the favour of pupils,
a favour to be maintained in competition with dances, movies,
and <cite>The Saturday Evening Post</cite>, by interesting them. It is
therefore a common thing for teachers to repeat in diluted form
the courses which they took in college—and which in the
original were at best no saturate solutions of the subject. The
other day, on visiting a class in Shakespeare at a Y.M.C.A.
school, I ventured to suggest to the teacher that the method
used was rather advanced. “Ah, but my daughter at high
school,” he said, “is having Professor Blank’s course in the
mediæval drama.” Now such a course intended for graduate
students investigating sources, influences, and variations among
saints’ plays and mystery plays, could have no educational<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
value in material or method for a high-school pupil, but it was,
no doubt, as interesting as a Persian tale.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the colleges and the secondary schools are both
uncertain as regards the meaning and aim of general education,
it is not surprising to find the grade schools also at sea,
their pupils the victims both of meaningless tradition and reckless
experiment. The tradition of our grade schools, educational
experts tell us, was brought by Horace Mann from Prussia.
There the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Volkschule</i> was designed for the children of
the people, who should be trained with a view to remaining
in the station in which they had been born. At least, it may
be conceded, the German designers of the system had a purpose
in mind, and knew the means to attain it; but both purpose
and means are strangely at variance with American conditions
and ideals. Other experts have pointed out the extraordinary
retarding of the educational process after the first years, when
the child learns by a natural objective method some of the most
difficult processes of physical life, accomplishing extraordinary
feats of understanding and control; and some of the most hopeful
experiments in primary education look toward continuing
this natural method for a longer time. At present the principle
of regimentation seems to be the most important one in
the grade school, and as the pace is necessarily that of the
slowest, the pupils in general have a large amount of slack rope
which it is the problem of principals and teachers to draw in
and coil up. Altogether the grade school represents a degree
of waste and misdirection which would in itself account for
the tendencies toward mental caprice or stagnation which are
evident in the pupils who proceed from it.</p>

<p>Thus the parallel which Professor Wendell established between
our educational system and the mediæval church would
seem to have a certain foundation. In the colleges, as in the
monasteries, we have a group of ascetic specialists, sustained
in their labours by an apocalyptic vision of a world which they
can set on fire, and in which no flesh can live; and a mass of
idle, pleasure-loving youth of both sexes, except where some
Abbot Samson arises, with strong-arm methods momentarily
to reduce them to order and industry. In the high schools,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
as in the cathedrals, we have great congregations inspired by
the music, the lights, the incense, assisting at a ceremony of
which the meaning is as little understood as the miracle of
the mass. In the grade schools, as in the parish churches, we
have the humble workers, like Chaucer’s poor parson of the
town, trying with pathetic endeavour to meet the needs and
satisfy the desires of their flocks, under conditions of an educational
and political tyranny no less galling than was the
ecclesiastical.</p>

<p>But, we may well enquire, whence does this system draw its
power to impose itself upon the masses?—for even superstition
must have a sign which the blind can read, and a source of
appeal to human nature. The answer bears out still further
Professor Wendell’s parallel. The mediæval church drew its
authority from God, and to impose that authority upon the
masses it invented the method of propaganda. It claimed to
be able to release men from the burden which oppressed them
most heavily, their sins, and in conjunction with the secular
power it enforced its claims against all gainsayers, treating the
obstinate among them with a series of penalties, penance, excommunication,
the stake. Education finds its authority in
the human reason, and likewise imposes that authority by
propaganda. It too claims the power of salvation from the
evils which oppress men most sorely to-day—the social maladjustments,
“lynchings, strikes, trusts, immigration, racial controversies”—and
it is in alliance with the secular power to
preserve its monopoly of social remedies from the competition
of anything like direct action. Now it is clear that in the
religion of Christ in its pure form the church had a basis for
its claims to possess a power against sin, and a means of salvation.
Similarly it may be maintained that human reason,
allowed to act freely and disinterestedly, would be sufficient
to cope with the evils of our time and bring about a social
salvation. Indeed, it is curious to remark how nearly the
intellectual conclusions of reason have come to coincide with
the intuitive wisdom of Jesus. The church was faithless to its
mission by alliance with temporal power, by substituting its
own advancement for the will of God, by becoming an end in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
itself. Education likewise is by way of being faithless to
itself, by alliance with secular power, political and financial,
by the substitution of its own institutional advancement for
disinterested service of truth, by becoming likewise an end in
itself.</p>

<p>In one of the most remarkable pronouncements of the present
commencement season, President Hopkins of Dartmouth
College summarized the influences which make against what he
calls Verihood. They are first, Insufficiency of mentality, or
over-professionalization of point of view; second, Inertia of
mentality or closed mindedness; and third, False emphasis of
mentality or propaganda. The late war and its evil aftermath
have put in high relief the extent of this third influence.
President Hopkins speaks as one of the Cardinal Archbishops
of Education, and I quote his words with the authority which
his personality and position give them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Now that the war is passed, the spirit of propaganda still
remains in the reluctance with which is returned to an impatient
people the ancient right of access to knowledge of the
truth, the right of free assembly, and the right of freedom of
speech. Meanwhile the hesitancy with which these are returned
breeds in large groups vague suspicion and acrimonious
distrust of that which is published as truth, and which actually
is true, so that on all sides we hear the query whether
we are being indulged with what is considered good for us,
or with that which constitutes the facts. Thus we impair the
validity of truth and open the door and give opportunity for
authority which is not justly theirs to be ascribed to falsehood
and deceit.”</p>
</div>

<p>The war was a test which showed how feeble was the hold
of American education upon the principle which alone can
give it validity. Nowhere was the suppression of freedom of
mind, of truth, so energetic, so vindictive as in the schools.
Instances crowd upon the mind. I remember attending the
trial of a teacher before a committee of the New York School
Board, the point being whether his reasons for not entering
with his class upon a discussion of the Soviet government concealed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
a latent sympathy with that form of social organization.
The pupils were ranged in two groups, Jews and Gentiles, and
were summoned in turn to give their testimony—they had
previously been educated in the important functions of modern
American society, espionage, and mass action. Another occasion
is commemorated by the New York <cite>Evening Post</cite>, the
teacher being on trial for disloyalty and the chief count in his
indictment that he desired an early peace; and his accuser, one
Dr. John Tildsley, an Archdeacon or superintendent of the
diocese of New York under Bishop Ettinger:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Are you interested in having this man discharged?”</p>

<p>“I am,” said Dr. Tildsley.</p>

<p>“Do you know of any act that would condemn him as a
teacher?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dr. Tildsley, “he favoured an early peace.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want an early, victorious peace?”</p>

<p>“Why ask me a question like that?”</p>

<p>“Because I want to show you how unfair you have been to
this teacher.”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Mufson wanted an early peace without victory,”
said Dr. Tildsley.</p>

<p>“He didn’t say that, did he? He did not say an early
peace without victory?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t want an early peace, do you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You want a prolongation of all this world misery?”</p>

<p>“To a certain extent, yes,” said Dr. Tildsley.</p>
</div>

<p>Nor did the sabotage of truth stop with school boards and
superintendents. A colleague of mine writing a chapter of a
text-book in modern history made the statement that the British
government entered the war because of an understanding
with France, the invasion of Belgium being the pretext which
appealed to popular enthusiasm—to which a great publishing
house responded that this statement would arouse much indignation
among the American people, and must therefore be
suppressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>We need not be surprised that since the war education has
not shown a disinterested and impartial attitude toward the
phenomena of human affairs, a reliance on the method of trial
and error, of experiment and testimony, which it has evolved.
Teachers who are openly, or even latently, in sympathy with a
form of social organization other than the régime of private
control of capital are banned from schools and colleges with
candle, with book, and with bell. Text-books which do not
agree with the convenient view of international relations are
barred. Superintendents like Ettinger and Tildsley in New
York are the devoted apologists for the system to which
they owe their greatness. To its position among the vested
interests of the world, to the prosperity of its higher clergy,
education has sacrificed its loyalty to that which alone can
give it authority.</p>

<p>The prevention of freedom of thought and enquiry is of
course necessary so long as the purpose of education is to
produce belief rather than to stimulate thought. The belief
which it is the function of education to propagate is that
in the existing order. Hence we find the vast effort known
as “Americanization,” which is for the most part a perfect
example of American education at the present day. The spirit
of “Americanization” is to consider the individual not with
reference to his inward growth of mind and spirit, but solely
with a view to his worldly success, and his relation to the
existing order of society, to which it is considered that the
individual will find his highest happiness and usefulness in
contributing. This programme naturally enough finds a sponsor
in the American Legion, but it is truly disconcerting to
find the National Education Association entering into alliance
with this super-legal body, appointing a standing committee to
act in co-operation with the Legion throughout the year, accepting
the offer of the Legion to give lectures in the schools,
and endorsing the principle of the Lusk Law in New York,
which imposes the test of an oath of allegiance to the Government
as a requirement for a teacher’s certificate.</p>

<p>We have now the chief reason why education remains the
dominant superstition of our time; but one may still wonder
how an institution which is apparently so uncertain of its purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
and methods can continue to exercise such influence on
the minds and hearts of men. The answer is, of course, that
education is not in the least doubtful of its purpose and methods.
Though the humble and obscure teacher, like the Lollard
parson, may puzzle his brains about the why and how and
purpose of his being here, his superiors, the bishops, the papal
curia, know the reason. Education is the propaganda department
of the State, and the existing social system. Its resolute
insistence upon the essential rightness of things as they
are, coupled with its modest promise to reform them if necessary,
is the basis of the touching confidence with which it is
received. It further imposes itself upon the credulity of the
people by the magnificence of its establishment. The academic
splendour of the commencement season when the hierarchs
bestow their favours, and honour each other and their
patrons by higher degrees, is of enormous value in impressing
the public. Especially to the uneducated does this majesty
appeal. That an institution which holds so fair an outlook
on society, which is on such easy and sympathetic terms with
all that is important in the nation, which commands the avenues
by which men go forward in the world, should be able to
guarantee success in life to its worshippers is nothing at which
to be surprised. Hence we find the poor of different grades
making every sacrifice to send sons and daughters through
high school, through college, in the same pathetic faith with
which they once burned candles to win respite for the souls
of their dead.</p>

<p>There are reasons, however, for thinking that the superstition
is passing. In the first place, nowhere do we find more
scepticism in regard to the pretensions of education than among
those who have been educated, and this number is rapidly
increasing. In the second place, the alliance between education
and a social system depending on private capital is too
obvious, and the abrogation of the true functions of the former
is too complete. The so-called Americanization campaign
is so crude an attempt to put something over that even the unsophisticated
foreigner whom it is intended to impress watches
the pictures or reads the pamphlets which set forth the happy
estate of the American workman, with his tongue in his cheek.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
The social groups which feel aggrieved under the present order
are marking their defection by seceding from the educational
system and setting up labour universities of their own.
So serious is this secession that New York has passed the Lusk
Law, designed to bring the independent movement under State
control. In the third place, the claim of education to be an
open sesame to success in life is contradicted by the position
of its most constant votaries, the teachers. The prestige which
used to attach to the priests of learning and which placed them
above the lure of riches has vanished; their economic station
has declined until even college professors have fallen into the
servantless class, which means the proletariat. Truly for such
as they to declare that education means success in life is a
dismal paradox.</p>

<p>Another sign of approaching reformation in the educational
system is to be found in the frankly corrupt practices which
infest it. Here the parallel to the mediæval church is not
exact, for in the latter it was the monasteries and religious
houses that were the chief sources of offence, while the colleges
and private institutions of higher learning which correspond
to them are singularly free from anything worse than
wasteful internal politics. It is the public educational system
which by reason of its contact with political government partakes
most palpably of the corruption that attends the democratic
State. It is unnecessary to mention the forms which
this corruption takes where a school board of trustees by
political appointment is given the exploitation of the schools—the
favouritism in appointments and promotions, the graft in
text-books and equipment, the speculation in real estate and
building contracts, the alienation of school property. There is
scarcely a large city in the country in which pupils and teachers
alike are not shamefully and scandalously defrauded by
action of school trustees which can be characterized in the
mildest terms as wilful mismanagement conducing to private
profit.</p>

<p>There are two things necessary to the reform of education.
One is democratic control, that is, management of institutions
of teaching by the teachers. It is to be noted that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
this is the demand everywhere of labour which respects itself—control
of the means of production and responsibility for
the result. Surely the teachers should be one of the first
groups of toilers to be so trusted. Under democratic control
the spoliation of the schools by politicians, the sacrifice of
education to propaganda, the tyranny of the hierarchy can
be successfully resisted. Once the teachers are released from
servile bondage to the public through the political masters who
control appointments and promotions, they will deal with their
problems with more authority, and be independent of the
suffrage of the pupils. Through joint responsibility of the
workers for the product they will arrive at that <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>
which consists in thinking in terms of the enterprise rather
than of the job, and from which we may expect a true method
of education. Already the movement toward democratic control
of teaching is taking form in school systems and colleges.
There are a hundred and fifty unions of teachers affiliated with
the American Federation of Labour. But the true analogy is
not between teachers and labour, but between education and
other professions. To quote Dr. H. M. Kallen:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To the discoverers and creators of Knowledge, and to its
transmitters and distributors, to these and to no one else beside
belongs the control of education. It is as absurd that any
but teachers and investigators should govern the art of education
as that any but medical practitioners and investigators
should govern the art of medicine.”</p>
</div>

<p>The other thing needful to restore education to health and
usefulness is that it should surrender its hold upon the superstitious
adoration of the public, by giving up its pretensions
to individual or social salvation, by ceasing its flattery of
nationalistic and capitalistic ambitions, and by laying aside
its pomps and ceremonies which conduce mainly to sycophancy
and cant. Education has shown in special lines that it can
be thoroughly scientific, disinterested, devoted. It is its task
to translate these virtues of the specialist into the general field.
It is not the business of education to humbug the people in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
the interest of what any person may think to be for their or
for his advantage. It is its business to deal frankly and honestly
with them, accepting in the most literal sense the responsibility
and the promise contained in the text: “Ye shall know
the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SCHOLARSHIP_AND_CRITICISM">SCHOLARSHIP AND CRITICISM</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> is natural for the musician to think any land barbarous
if it has produced no great composers, the painter if it has
produced no great painters, the critic or the scholar if it has
produced no great scholars and critics, and so on for all the
other arts and sciences. But it is idle to insist that every
race should express itself in the same way, or to assume that
the genius of a nation can be tested by its deficiencies in any
single field of the higher life. Great critics are rare in every
age and country; and even if they were not, what consolation
is there for the clash and diversity of races and nations except
the special and diverse gifts which each may furnish to the
spiritual whole? England has achieved greatness without
great music, Germany without great sculpture, ancient Rome
without great science or philosophy, Judæa with little but
poetry and religion; and it is not necessary to lay too much
stress on our own lack of great scholars and great critics—yes,
even on our lack of great poets and great painters. They
may come to-day or to-morrow, or we may be destined never
to have them. The idea that great national energy must inevitably
flower in a great literature, and that our wide-flung
power must certainly find expression in an immortal poem or
in the “great American novel,” is merely another example of
our mechanical optimism. The vision of great empires that
have been both strong and silent, Assyria, Babylonia, Egypt,
haunts all history; Virgil or Camoens only fitfully expresses
the power that is summed up in Cæsar or Magellan.</p>

<p>But without insisting on impossible aims or illusory standards
of greatness, it is fair to ask some flow of spiritual activity,
some general spirit of diffused culture,—in a word, the presence
of a soul. For though we must eat (and common sense
will cook better dinners than philosophy), though we must
work (and the captain of industry can organize trade better
than the poet), though we must play (and the athlete can win
more games than the scholar), the civilization that has no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
higher outlets for its intellect and imagination will show at
least some marks of spiritual starvation. You may see the
signs of its restless gnawing on the face of almost any American
woman beyond the first flush of youth; you may see some
shadow of its hopeless craving on the face of almost any mature
American man.</p>

<p>The same signs are to be seen in American scholarship and
American criticism. If scholarship were what most people
think it, the dull learning of pedants, and criticism merely the
carping and bickering of fault-finders, the fact would hardly
be worth recording. But since they are instruments which
the mind of man uses for some of its keenest questionings,
their absence or their weakness must indicate something at
least in the national life and character which it is not unimportant
to understand.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The tradition of scholarship, like so many other things, comes
to us from what used to be called the Renaissance, the period
(it may not be ironical to be reminded) in which the Americas
were discovered and explored; and whatever savour of distinction
inheres in the idea of “the gentleman and the scholar”
was created then. Scholarship at first meant merely a
knowledge of the classics, and though it has since widened its
scope, even then the diversity of its problems was apparent, for
the classical writers had tilled many fields of human knowledge,
and the student of Homer and Virgil was really faced
with a different problem from the student of Plato or Thucydides.
Scholarship has never been a reality, a field that could
be bounded and defined in the sense in which poetry, philosophy,
and history can be. It is a point of view, an attitude,
a method of approach, and, so far as its meaning and purpose
can be captured, it may be said to be the discipline and illumination
that come from the intellectual mastery of a definite
problem involved in the growth of the human spirit.</p>

<p>Scholarship, conceived in this sense, has no history (though
dull and learned hodge-podges have served as such), for it is
a spirit diffused over various fields of study; and in America<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
this spirit has scarcely even come into existence. American
Universities seem to have been created for the special purpose
of ignoring or destroying it. The chief monuments of American
scholarship have seldom if ever come from men who have
been willing to live their whole lives in an academic atmosphere.
The men whom we think of as our foremost literary scholars,
Gildersleeve, Norton, and the rest, acquired their fame
rather through their personalities than their scholarly achievements.
The historians, Motley, Prescott, Bancroft, Parkman,
Rhodes, Lea, Fiske, Mahan, were not professors; books like
Taylor’s “Mediæval Mind,” Henry Adams’s “Mont Saint
Michel and Chartres,” Thayer’s “Cavour,” Villard’s “John
Brown,” and Beveridge’s “John Marshall,” even Ticknor’s
“History of Spanish Literature,” were not written within University
walls, though Ticknor’s sixteen years of teaching tamed
the work of a brilliant man of the world until there is little
left save the characteristic juiceless virtue of an intelligent ordering
of laborious research. It would seem as if in the atmosphere
of our Universities personality could not find fruitage
in scholarly achievement worthy of it, and learning can only
thrive when it gives no hostages to the enemy, personality.</p>

<p>Of the typical products of this academic system, the lowest
is perhaps the literary dissertation and the highest the historical
manual or text-book. It may be because history is not
my own special field of study that I seem to find its practitioners
more vigorous intellectually than the literary scholars.
Certainly our historians seem to have a special aptitude for
compiling careful summaries of historical periods, and some of
these have an ordered reasonableness and impersonal efficiency
not unlike that of the financial accounting system of our large
trusts or the budgets of our large universities. To me most of
them seem feats of historical engineering rather than of historical
scholarship; and if they represent a scholarly “advance”
on older and less accurate work, written before Clio
became a peon of the professors, it can only be said that history
has not yet recovered from the advance. Nor am I as much
impressed as the historians themselves by the more recent clash
between the “old” school and the “new,” for both seem to me
equally lacking in a truly philosophic conception of the meaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
of history. Yet there is among the younger breed a certain
freshness of mind and an openness to new ideas, though less to
the problems of human personality or to the emotional and
spiritual values of man’s life. This deficiency is especially irritating
in the field of biography. Not even an American opera
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">corruptio optimi</i>) is as wooden as the biographies of our
statesmen and national heroes; and if American lives written
by Englishmen have been received with enthusiasm, it was less
because of any inherent excellence than because they at least
conceived of Hamilton or Lincoln as a man and not as an historical
document or a political platitude.</p>

<p>But literary scholarship is in far worse plight in our Universities.
No great work of classical learning has ever been
achieved by an American scholar. It may be unfair to suggest
comparison with men like Gilbert Murray, Croiset, or Wilamowitz;
but how can we be persuaded by the professors or even
by a dean that all culture will die if we forget Greek and
Latin, until they satisfy us by their own work that they themselves
are alive? Asia beckons to us with the hand of Fate,
but Oriental scholarship is a desert through which a few
nomadic professors wander aimlessly. As to the literatures in
the modern European tongues, Dante scholarship has perhaps
the oldest and most respectable tradition, but on examination
dwindles into its proper proportions: an essay by Lowell and
translations by Longfellow and Norton pointed the way; a
Dante Society has nursed it; and its modern fruits, with one
or two honourable exceptions, are a few unilluminating articles
and text-books. Ticknor’s pioneer work in the Spanish field
has had no successors, though Spanish America is at our
doors; the generous subsidies of rich men have resulted as
usual in buildings but not in scholarship. Of the general level
of our French and German studies I prefer to say nothing;
and silence is also wisest in the case of English. This field
fairly teems with professors; Harvard has twice as many as
Oxford and Cambridge combined, and the University of Chicago
almost as many as the whole of England. Whether this
plethora of professors has justified itself, either by distinguished
works of scholarship or by helping young America to
love literature and to write good English, I shall not decide, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
leave entirely to their own conscience. This at least may be
said, that the mole is not allowed to burrow in his hole without
disturbance; for in this atmosphere, as a protest and counterfoil,
or as a token of submission to the idols of the market-place,
there has arisen a very characteristic academic product,—the
professor who writes popular articles, sometimes clever,
sometimes precious, sometimes genteel and refined, sometimes
merely commonplace, but almost always devoid of real knowledge
or stimulating thought. Even the sober pedant is a more
humane creature than the professorial smart-Aleck.</p>

<p>Whence arises this inhibition of mediocrity, this fear of personality
and intellect, this deep antinomy of pedant and dilettante?
The “fear-of-giving-themselves-away disease” which
affected the professors of the Colleges of Unreason in “Erewhon”
is mildly endemic in every University in the world, and
to a certain degree in every profession; but nowhere else does it
give the tone to the intellectual life of a whole people. If I
were a sociologist, confident that the proper search would unearth
an external cause for every spiritual defect, I might
point to any one of a dozen or more damning facts as the origin
and source of all our trouble,—to the materialism of a national
life directed solely toward practical ends, to the levelling and
standardizing influences of democracy, to Anglo-Saxon “Colonialism,”
to the influence of German erudition, or to the
inadequate economic rewards of the academic life. I should
probably make much of that favourite theme of critical fantasy,
the habits derived from the “age of the pioneers,” a period in
which life, with its mere physical discomforts and its mere
demands on physical energy and endurance, was really so easy
and simple that Americans attempt to reproduce it on all their
holidays.</p>

<p>But in so far as they have any reality, all these are merely
symptoms of the same disease of the soul. The modern sanatorium
may be likened to the mediæval monastery without its
spiritual faith; the American University to a University without
its inner illumination. It is an intellectual refuge without the
integration of a central soul,—crassly material because it has
no inner standards to redeem it from the idols of the market-place,
or timid and anæmic because it lacks that quixotic fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
which inheres in every act of faith. It is at one and the same
time our greatest practical achievement and our greatest
spiritual failure. To call it a compound of sanatorium and
machine-shop may seem grossly unfair to an institution which
has more than its share of earnest and high-minded men; but
though the phrase may not describe the reality, it does indicate
the danger. When we find that in such a place education does
not educate, we cry for help to the only gods we know, the
restless gods of Administration and Organization; but scholarship
cannot be organized or administered into existence, even
by Americans.</p>

<p>What can we say (though it seem to evade the question)
save that America has no scholarship because as yet it has a
body but no soul? The scholar goes through all the proper
motions,—collects facts, organizes research, delivers lectures,
writes articles and sometimes books,—but under this outer
seeming there is no inner reality. Under all the great works
of culture there broods the quivering soul of tradition, a burden
sometimes disturbing and heavy to bear, but more often
helping the soul to soar on wings not of its own making. We
think hungrily that the freshness of outlook of a young people
should be more than compensation; but the freshness is not
there. Bad habits long persisted in, or new vices painfully
acquired, may pass for traditions among some spokesmen of
“Americanism,” but will not breathe the breath of life into
a national culture. All is shell, mask, and a deep inner emptiness.
We have scholars without scholarship, as there are
churches without religion.</p>

<p>Until there comes a change of heart or a new faith or a deep
inner searching, scholarship must continue to live this thwarted
and frustrated life. Only a profound realization of its high
purpose and special function, and the pride that comes from
this realization, can give the scholar his true place in an
American world. For this special function is none other than
to act as the devoted servant of thought and imagination and
to champion their claims as the twin pillars that support all
the spiritual activities of human life,—art, philosophy, religion,
science; and these it must champion against all the materialists
under whatever name they disguise their purpose. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
matter whether they be scientists who decry “dialectics,” or
sociologists who sneer at “mere belles-lettres,” or practical
men who have no use for the “higher life”? Whether
they be called bourgeois or radical, conservative or intellectual,—all
who would reduce life to a problem of practical activity
and physical satisfaction, all who would reduce intellect and
imagination to mere instruments of practical usefulness, all
who worship dead idols instead of living gods, all who grasp at
every flitting will-o’-the-wisp of theory or sensation,—all these
alike scholarship must forever recognize as its enemies, and its
chief tempters.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Scholarship, so conceived, is the basis of criticism. When a
few years ago I published a volume which bore the subtitle of
“Essays on the Unity of Genius and Taste,” the pedants and
the professors were in the ascendant, and it seemed necessary
to emphasize the side of criticism which was then in danger,
the side that is closest to the art of the creator. But the professors
have been temporarily routed by the dilettanti, the
amateurs, and the journalists, who treat a work of the imagination
as if they were describing fireworks or a bull-fight (to
use a phrase of Zola’s about Gautier); and so it is necessary
now to insist on the discipline and illumination of scholarship,—in
other Words, to write an “Essay on the Divergence of
Criticism and Creation.”</p>

<p>American criticism, like that of England, but to an even
greater extent, suffers from a want of philosophic insight
and precision. It has neither inherited nor created a tradition
of æsthetic thought. For it every critical problem is a separate
problem, a problem in a philosophic vacuum, and so open
for discussion to any astute mind with a taste for letters.
Realism, classicism, romanticism, imagism, impressionism, expressionism,
and other terms or movements as they spring up,
seem ultimate realities instead of matters of very subordinate
concern to any philosophy of art,—mere practical programmes
which bear somewhat the same relation to æsthetic truth that
the platform of the Republican Party bears to Aristotle’s “Politics”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
or Marx’s “Capital.” As a result, critics are constantly
carrying on a guerilla warfare of their own in favour of some
vague literary shibboleth or sociological abstraction, and discovering
anew the virtues or vices of individuality, modernity,
Puritanism, the romantic spirit or the spirit of the Middle
West, the traditions of the pioneer, and so on ad infinitum.
This holds true of every school of American criticism, “conservative”
or “radical”; for all of them a disconnected body
of literary theories takes the place of a real philosophy of art.
“Find an idea and then write about it” sums up the American
conception of criticism. Now, while the critic must approach
a work of literature without preconceived notion of what that
individual work should attempt, he cannot criticize it without
some understanding of what all literature attempts. The critic
without an æsthetic is a mariner without chart, compass, or
knowledge of navigation; for the question is not where the
ship should go or what cargo it should carry, but whether it is
going to arrive at any port at all without sinking.</p>

<p>Criticism is essentially an expression of taste, or that faculty
of imaginative sympathy by which the reader or spectator is
able to re-live the vision created by the artist. This is the soil
without which it cannot flourish; but it attains its end and
becomes criticism in the highest sense only when taste is guided
by knowledge and thought. Of these three elements, implicit
in all real criticism, the professors have made light of taste,
and have made thought itself subservient to knowledge, while
the dilettanti have considered it possible to dispense with both
knowledge and thought. But even dilettante criticism is preferable
to the dogmatic and intellectualist criticism of the professors,
on the same grounds that Sainte-Beuve is superior to
Brunetière, or Hazlitt to Francis Jeffrey; for the dilettante at
least meets the mind of the artist on the plane of imagination
and taste, while the intellectualist or moralist is precluded by
his temperament and his theories from ever understanding the
primal thrill and purpose of the creative act.</p>

<p>Back of any philosophy of art there must be a philosophy
of life, and all æsthetic formulæ seem empty unless there is
richness of content behind them. The critic, like the poet or
the philosopher, has the whole world to range in, and the farther<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
he ranges in it, the better his work will be. Yet this does
not mean that criticism should focus its attention on morals,
history, life, instead of on the forms into which the artist transforms
them. Art has something else to give us; and to seek
morals, or economic theories, or the national spirit in it is to
seek morals, economic theories, the national spirit, but not
art. Indeed, the United States is the only civilized country
where morals are still in controversy so far as creative literature
is concerned; France, Germany, and Italy liberated themselves
from this faded obsession long ago; even in England
critics of authority hesitate to judge a work of art by moral
standards. Yet this is precisely what divides the two chief
schools of American criticism, the moralists and the anti-moralists,
though even among the latter masquerade some whose
only quarrel with the moralists is the nature of the moral standards
employed.</p>

<p>Disregarding the Coleridgean tradition, which seems to have
come to an end with Mr. Woodberry, and the influence of the
“new psychology,” which has not yet taken a definite form, the
main forces that have influenced the present clashes in the
American attitude toward literature seem to be three. There
is first of all the conception of literature as a moral influence,
a conception which goes back to the Græco-Roman rhetoricians
and moralists, and after pervading English thought from
Sidney to Matthew Arnold, finds its last stronghold to-day
among the American descendants of the Puritans. There is,
secondly, the Shavian conception of literature as the most effective
vehicle for a new <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Weltanschauung</i>, to be judged by the
novelty and freshness of its ideas, a conception particularly
attractive to the school of young reformers, radicals, and intellectuals
whose interest in the creative imagination is secondary,
and whose training in æsthetic thought has been negligible;
this is merely an obverse of the Puritan moralism, and
is tainted by the same fundamental misconception of the meaning
of the creative imagination. And there is finally the conception
of literature as an external thing, a complex of rhythms,
charm, beauty without inner content, or mere theatrical effectiveness,
which goes back through the English ’nineties to the
French ’seventies, when the idea of the independence of art<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
from moral and intellectual standards was distorted into the
merely mechanical theory of “art for art’s sake”; the French
have a special talent for narrowing æsthetic truths into hard-and-fast
formulæ, devoid of their original nucleus of philosophic
reality, but all the more effective on this account for universal
conquest as practical programmes.</p>

<p>The apparent paradox which none of these critics face is
that the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Weltanschauung</i> of the creative artist, his moral convictions,
his views on intellectual, economic, and other subjects,
furnish the content of his work and are at the same time the
chief obstacles to his artistic achievement. Out of morals or
philosophy he has to make, not morals or philosophy, but
poetry; for morals and philosophy are only a part, and a small
part, of the whole reality which his imagination has to encompass.
The man who is overwhelmed with moral theories
and convictions would naturally find it easiest to become a
moralist, and moralists are prosaic, not poetic. A man who
has strong economic convictions would find it easiest to become
an economist or economic reformer, and economics too
is the prose of life, not the poetry. A man with a strong philosophic
bias would find it easiest to become a pure thinker,
and the poet’s visionary world topples when laid open to the
cold scrutiny of logic. A poet is a human being, and therefore
likely to have convictions, prejudices, preconceptions, like
other men; but the deeper his interest in them is, the easier
it is for him to become a moralist, economist, philosopher, or
what not, and the harder for him to transcend them and to become
a poet. But if the genius of the poet (and by poet I
mean any writer of imaginative literature) is strong enough,
it will transcend them, pass over them by the power of the
imagination, which leaves them behind without knowing it.
It has been well said that morals are one reality, a poem is another
reality, and the illusion consists in thinking them one
and the same. The poet’s conscience as a man may be satisfied
by the illusion, but woe to him if it is not an illusion, for
that is what we tell him when we say, “He is a moralist, not
a poet.” Such a man has really expressed his moral convictions,
instead of leaping over and beyond them into that world
of the imagination where moral ideas must be interpreted from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
the standpoint of poetry, or the artistic needs of the characters
portrayed, and not by the logical or reality value of morals.</p>

<p>This “leaping over” is the test of all art; it is inherent in
the very nature of the creative imagination. It explains, for
example, how Milton the moralist started out to make Satan
a demon and how Milton the poet ended by making him a hero.
It explains the blindness of the American critic who recently
objected to the “loose thinking” of a poem of Carl Sandburg
in which steel is conceived of as made of smoke and blood, and
who propounded this question to the Walrus and the Carpenter:
“How can smoke, the lighter refuse of steel, be one of its
constituents, and how can the smoke which drifts away from
the chimney and the blood which flows in the steelmaker’s veins
be correlates in their relation to steel?” Where shall we match
this precious gem? Over two centuries ago, Othello’s cry after
the death of Desdemona,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">“O heavy hour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Methinks it should now be a huge eclipse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of sun and moon!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">provoked another intellectualist critic to enquire whether “the
sun and moon can both together be so hugely eclipsed in any
one heavy hour whatsoever;” but Rymer has been called “the
worst critic that ever lived” for applying tests like these to the
poetry of Shakespeare. Over a century ago a certain Abbé
Morellet, unmoved by the music of Chateaubriand’s description
of the <span class="locked">moon,—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“She pours forth in the woods this great secret of melancholy
which she loves to recount to the old oaks and the ancient shores
of the <span class="locked">sea,”—</span></p>
</div>

<p class="in0">asked his readers: “How can the melancholy of night be called
a secret; and if the moon recounts it, how is it still a secret;
and how does she manage to recount it to the old oaks and the
ancient shores of the sea rather than to the deep valleys, the
mountains, and the rivers?”</p>

<p>These are simply exaggerations of the inevitable consequence
of carrying over the mood of actual life into the world of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
imagination. “Sense, sense, nothing but sense!” cried a great
Austrian poet, “as if poetry in contrast with prose were not
always a kind of divine nonsense. Every poetic image bears
within itself its own certain demonstration that logic is not the
arbitress of art.” And Alfieri spoke for every poet in the world
when he said of himself, “Reasoning and judging are for me
only pure and generous forms of feeling.” The trained
economist, philosopher, or moralist, examining the ideas of a
poet, is always likely to say: “These are not clearly thought
out or logical ideas; they are just a poet’s fancy or inspiration;”
and that is the final praise of the poet. If the expert
finds a closely reasoned treatise we may be sure that we shall
find no poetry. It is a vision of reality, and not reality, imagination
and not thought or morals, that the artist gives us; and
his spiritual world, with all that it means for the soaring life
of man, fades and disappears when we bring to it no other test
than the test of reality.</p>

<p>These are some of the elementary reasons why those who
demand of the poet a definite code of morals or manners—“American
ideals,” or “Puritanism,” or on the other side,
“radical ideas”—seem to me to show their incompetence as
critics. How can we expect illumination from those who share
the “typical American business man’s” inherent inability to
live in the world of fantasy which the poets have created, without
the business man’s ability to face the external facts of life
and mould them to his will? These men are schoolmasters,
pedants, moralists, policemen, but neither critics nor true lovers
of the spiritual food that art provides. To the creative writers
of America I should give a wholly different message from theirs.
I should say to them: “Express what is in you, all that serene
or turbulent vision of multitudinous life which is yours by right
of imagination, trusting in your own power to achieve discipline
and mastery, and leave the discussion of ‘American ideals’
to statesmen, historians, and philosophers, with the certainty
that if you truly express the vision that is in you, the statesmen,
historians, and philosophers of the future will point to
your work as a fine expression of the ‘American ideals’ you
have helped to create.”</p>

<p>But it is no part of the critic’s duty to lay down laws for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
the guidance of the creator, though he may have insight enough
to foresee some of the directions which literature is likely to
take. He may even point out new material for the imagination
of poets to feed on,—the beautiful folklore of our native
Indians, the unplumbed depths of the Negro’s soul, the poetry
and wisdom of Asia (which it may be our chief destiny to interpret
for the nations of Europe), the myth and story of the
hundred races that are to make up the new America, and all
the undiscovered coigns and crannies of our national life. I
shall not say that these services are extraneous and unimportant,
like furnishing the fountain-pen with which a great poem
is written; but incursions into the geography of the imagination
are incidental to the critic’s main duty of interpreting
literature and making its meaning and purpose clear to all who
wish to love and understand it.</p>

<p>The first need of American criticism to-day is education in
æsthetic thinking. It needs above all the cleansing and stimulating
power of an intellectual bath. Only the drenching discipline
that comes from intellectual mastery of the problems of
æsthetic thought can train us for the duty of interpreting the
American literature of the future. The anarchy of impressionism
is a natural reaction against the mechanical theories
and jejune text-books of the professors, but it is a temporary
haven and not a home. The haphazard empiricism of English
criticism and the faded moralism of our own will serve us no
more. We must desert these muddy waters, and seek purer
and deeper streams. In a country where philosophers urge men
to cease thinking, it may be the task of the critic to revivify
and reorganize thought. Only in this way can we gain what
America lacks, the brain-illumined soul.</p>

<p>The second need of American criticism can be summed up
in the word scholarship—that discipline of knowledge which
will give us at one and the same time a wider international outlook
and a deeper national insight. One will spring from the
other, for the timid Colonial spirit finds no place in the heart
of the citizen of the world; and respect for native talent, born
of a surer knowledge, will prevent us alike from overrating its
merits and from holding it too cheap. Half-knowledge is either
too timid or too cocksure; and only out of this spiritual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
discipline can come a true independence of judgment and
taste.</p>

<p>For taste is after all both the point of departure and the
goal; and the third and greatest need of American criticism
is a deeper sensibility, a more complete submission to the
imaginative will of the artist, before attempting to rise above
it into the realm of judgment. If there is anything that American
life can be said to give least of all, it is training in taste.
There is a deadness of artistic feeling, which is sometimes replaced
or disguised by a fervour of sociological obsession, but
this is no substitute for the faculty of imaginative sympathy
which is at the heart of all criticism. When the social historian
is born, the critic dies; for taste, or æsthetic enjoyment, is the
only gateway to the critic’s judgment, and over it is a flaming
signpost, “Critic, abandon all hope when this gate is shut.”</p>

<p class="in0">Only out of the fusion of these three elements of taste, intellect,
and knowledge can American criticism gain what in one of its
manifestations is called “personality” and in another “style.”
Only in this way can it win in the battle against the benumbing
chaos and the benumbing monotony of American art and life.</p>

<p>We are all cocksure but bewildered children in a world we
cannot understand. We are all parvenus—parvenus on a new
continent, on the fringes of which some have lived a little
longer than others, but the whole of which has been encompassed
by none of us for more than two or three generations;
parvenus in a new world of steam and electricity, wireless and
aeroplane, machinery and industry, which none of us has yet
been able to subdue to a mould that satisfies our deepest cravings;
parvenus in our culture, which still seems like a borrowed
garment instead of flesh of our flesh and bone of our bone.
What is the good of all the instruments that our hands have
moulded if we have neither the will nor the imagination to
wield them for the uses of the soul? Not in this fashion shall
we justify our old dream of an America that is the hope of the
world. Here are hundreds of colleges and universities; why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
not fill these empty barracks with scholars and thinkers? Here
are a hundred races; why not say to them: “America can give
you generous opportunity and the most superb instruments that
the undisciplined energy of practical life has ever created, but
in the spiritual fields of art, poetry, religion, culture, it has little
or nothing to give you; let us all work together, learning and
creating these high things side by side”? Here are more hearts
empty and unfulfilled and more restless minds than the world
has ever before gathered together; why not lead them out of
their corrals, and find a fitting pasture for their brains and
souls?</p>

<h3><i>GLOSSARY</i></h3>

<p>The English language, extraordinarily rich and expressive in
everything that concerns the practical or the imaginative life, suffers
from the poverty and lack of precision of English æsthetic thought.
It may therefore be useful to indicate briefly the special sense in
which certain terms are used in this essay.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Spectator</i>: I should say that you have advanced a subtlety that is
little more than a play on words.</p>

<p>“<i>Friend</i>: And I maintain that when we are speaking of the operations
of the soul, no words can be delicate and subtle enough.”—<span class="smcap">Goethe.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot hang">

<p><i>Art</i>—Any creation of the imagination, whether in the form of
imaginative literature or of painting, sculpture, music, etc.</p>

<p><i>Artist</i>—The creator of a work of art in any of its forms; not used
in this essay in the narrower sense of painter or sculptor.</p>

<p><i>Taste</i>—The faculty of imaginative sympathy by which the reader
or spectator is able to re-live the vision of the artist, and therefore
the essential pre-requisite to all criticism.</p>

<p><i>Criticism</i>—Any expression of taste guided by knowledge and
thought. (The critic’s training in knowledge is scholarship, and
his special field of thought æsthetics.)</p>

<p><i>Æsthetics</i>—An ordered and reasoned conception of the meaning
and purpose of art, intended for the guidance of the critic and
not of the artist.</p>

<p><i>A Literary Theory</i>—An isolated “idea” or theory in regard to
imaginative literature, without reference to any ordered and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
reasoned conception of its meaning and purpose.</p>

<p><i>Impressionist Criticism</i>—Any expression of taste without adequate
guidance of knowledge or thought.</p>

<p><i>Intellectualist (or dogmatic) criticism</i>—Criticism based on the conception
that art is a product of thought rather than of imagination,
and that the creative fantasy of the artist can be limited
and judged by the critic’s pre-conceived theories; or in the more
ornate words of Francis Thompson, criticism that is “for ever
shearing the wild tresses of poetry between rusty rules.”</p>

<p><i>The Intellectuals</i>—All who lay undue stress on the place of intellect
in life, and assume that the turbulent flux of reality can be tied
up in neat parcels of intellectual formulæ.</p>

<p><i>Poetry</i>—All literature in which reality has been transfigured by the
imagination, including poetry in its narrower sense, the novel,
the drama, etc.; used instead of “imaginative literature,” not
merely for the sake of brevity, but as implying a special emphasis
on creative power.</p>

<p><i>Poet</i>—A writer of imaginative literature in any of its forms; not
used in this essay in the narrower sense of a writer of verse.</p>

<p><i>Learning</i>—The accumulation of certain forms of knowledge as a
basis for scholarship, but no more the main purpose of scholarship
than his preparatory training is the sole object of the
athlete or soldier.</p>

<p><i>Scholarship</i>—The discipline and illumination that come from the
intellectual mastery of a definite problem in the spiritual (as
opposed to the practical) life of man.</p>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Should</span> we ever entertain an intelligent explorer from
Mars, we should of course importune him, in season and
out, for his impressions of America. And if he were candid
as well as intelligent, he might ultimately be interviewed somewhat
as follows:</p>

<p>“At first I thought the most striking fact about you was
your passion for education. While I have been enjoying your
so thorough hospitality I have met a minority of Americans
who express themselves less complacently than the rest about
your material blessings; I have talked with a few dissidents
from your political theory; and I have even heard complaints
that it is possible to carry moral enthusiasm too far. But I
have yet to meet that American who is sceptical about education
as such, though on the other hand I have found few of
your citizens quite content with the working of every part of
your educational establishment. And this very discontent
was what clinched my first impression that schooling is the
most vital of your passionate interests.</p>

<p>“Yet as I have travelled from one to another of your cities,
a second fact about you has struck me so forcibly as to contest
the supremacy of the first. You Americans more and more
seem to me to be essentially alike. Your cities are only less
identical than the trains that ply between them. Nearly any
congregation could worship just as comfortably in nearly any
other church. The casts of almost any two plays, the staffs
of almost any two newspapers, even the faculties of almost any
two colleges could exchange ‘vehicles’ with about the same
results that would attend their exchanging clothes.</p>

<p>“And in nothing are you so alike as in your universal desire
to be alike—to be inconspicuous, to put on straw hats on the
same day, to change your clothes in Texas in accordance with
the seasons in New York, to read the books everybody else is
reading, to adopt the opinions a weekly digests for you from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
the almost uniform opinions of the whole of the daily press,
in war and peace to be incontestably and entirely American.</p>

<p>“Now, I should scarcely make bold to be so frank about
these observations if some of my new friends had not reassured
me with the information that they are not novel, that a distinguished
Englishman has put them into what you have considered
the most representative and have made the most popular
book about your commonwealth, that in fact you rather
enjoy having outsiders recognize the success of your efforts in
uniformity. There is, of course, no reason why you should not
be as similar to each other as you choose, and you must not
interpret my surprise to mean that I am shocked by anything
except the contradiction I find between this essential similarity
and what I have called your passion for education.</p>

<p>“On Mars it has for a long time been our idea that the
function of the school is to put our youth in touch with what all
sorts of Martians have thought and are thinking, have felt and
are feeling. I say ‘put in touch’ rather than ‘teach,’ because
it is not so much our notion to pack their minds and hearts as
to proffer samples of our various cultures and supply keys to
the storehouses—not unlike your libraries, museums, and laboratories—that
contain our records. We prefer to think of
schooling as a kind of thoroughfare between our past and our
present, an avenue to the recovery and appreciation of as many
as possible of those innumerable differences between Martian
and Martian, those conflicting speculations and cogitations,
myths and hypotheses regarding our planet and ourselves that
have gone into the warp and woof of our mental history.
Thus we have hoped not only to preserve and add to the body
of Martian knowledge, but also to understand better and utilize
more variously our present minds. So it seems to us perfectly
natural, and has rather pleased than distressed us, that our
students should emerge from their studies with a multitude
of differing sympathies, beliefs, tastes, and ambitions. We
have thought that such an education enriched the lives of all
of us, lives that ignorance could not fail to constrict and subject
to hum-drum monotony.</p>

<p>“So when I return to Mars and report that I found Earth’s
most favourable continent inhabited by its most literate great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
people, a people that has carried the use of print and other
means of communication to a point we Martians have never
dared dream about; that this people has at once the most
widely diffused enthusiasm for education and the most comprehensive
school equipment on Earth; and finally that this people
is at the same time the most uniform in its life—well, I fear
I shall not be believed.”</p>

<p>On subsequent visits the Martian might, as a wise man does
who is confronted by a logical impasse, re-examine the terms
of his paradox.</p>

<p>As regards our uniformity, fresh evidence could only endorse
his first impressions. The vestigial remnants of what regional
cultures we have had are rapidly being effaced by our unthinking
standardization in every department of life. The
railroad, the telephone and telegraph, the newspaper, the Ford,
the movies, advertising—all have scarcely standardized themselves
before they have set about standardizing everything
within their reach. Not even our provinces of the picturesque
are immune, the places and things we like to think of as “different”
(word that betrays our standard sameness!) and glamorous
of our romantic golden age. In the Old South, Birmingham
loves to call herself the Pittsburgh of the South; our railroads
have all but hounded the packets from the Mississippi;
it is notorious that our apostles to the Indians, whether political,
religious, or pedagogic, wage relentless war on the very
customs and traditions we cherish in legend; the beautiful Missions
that a kindlier evangelism bequeathed to them are repeated
and cheapened in every suburb and village of the land,
under every harsher sky; those once spontaneous fêtes of the
plains, the “Stampede” and the “Round-Up,” have been made
so spurious that the natives abandon them for a moth-eaten
Wild West Show made in the East; and in only a year or two
even New Orleans’ Mardi Gras will be indistinguishable from
its counterfeits in St. Louis and elsewhere.</p>

<p>As with these adventitious and perhaps not very important
regional differentiations, so with the one fundamental demarcation
our people have all along recognized as conditioning the
give-and-take of American life. The line between the East
and the West, advancing from the Alleghanies to the Rockies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
and then part of the way back, has never stayed long enough
in one zone to be precisely drawn, but it has always been
sharply felt. Since Colonial times the East has meant many
things—wealth, stability, contacts with Europe, refinement, industry,
centralized finance—and the West has meant many
things—hardship and adventure, El Dorado, outlawry, self-reliance,
agriculture, vast enterprise; but they have never been
so close to meaning the same things as to-day. To-morrow
they will merge. Even now the geographical line between
them may be drawn anywhere in a belt two thousand miles
wide, in which it will be fixed according to the nativity of the
critic rather than by any pronounced social stigmata. East or
West, there is a greater gulf between the intelligent and the
unintelligent of the same parish than divides the intelligent
of different parishes. East or West, Americans think pretty
much the same thoughts, feel about the same emotions, and
express themselves in the American tongue—that is, in slang.
If the slang, the accent, the manner differ noticeably, as they
still do, there are not wanting signs that another generation will
obliterate these differences too. Publishing, to be sure, tends
to concentrate in the East, though without impoverishing the
West, since all notable circulations have to be national to survive.
The very fact that the country’s publishing can be done
from New York, Philadelphia, and Boston demonstrates our
national unanimity of opinion and expression.</p>

<p>Before it overleapt the geographical walls, this national
unanimity had wiped out every class distinction but one, which
it has steadily tended to entrench—the money line. Families
may continue to hold their place only on the condition that
they keep their money or get more; and a moderate fortune,
no matter how quickly come by, has only to make a few correct
strokes, avoid a few obvious bunkers, and it will found a family
by inadvertence. The process is so simple that clerks
practise it during their vacations at the shore.</p>

<p>Besides money, there is one other qualification—personal
charm. Its chief function, perhaps, is to disguise the essentially
monetary character of American social life. At any
rate, Americans are almost as uniformly charming as they are
uniformly acquisitive. For the most part it is a negative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
charm, a careful skirting of certain national taboos: it eschews
frank egoism, unfavourable criticism, intellectual subtlety,
unique expressions of temperament, humour that is no respecter
of persons, anything that might disturb the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">status quo</i>
of reciprocal kindliness and complacent optimism. The unpopular
American is unpopular not because he is a duffer or
a bore, but because he is “conceited,” a “knocker,” a “highbrow,”
a “nut,” a “grouch,” or something of that ilk. We
do not choose, as the Martian suggested, to be as similar
as possible; we choose <em>not</em> to be dissimilar. If our convictions
about America and what is American sprang from real knowledge
of ourselves and of our capacities, we should relish egoists,
disinterested critics, intellectuals, artists, and irreverent
humourists, instead of suppressing them when we cannot
mould them. That we do not relish them, that we protect
ourselves from them, is evidence that we fear them. What
reason should we have to fear them save a secret distrust of
our asseverated convictions? Our unanimity, then, would seem
to the Martian to be an artificial substitute for some natural
background we lack but should like to have; and a most dangerous
wish-fulfilment it is, for it masks our ignorance of what
we are and what we may reasonably become. Far from being
self-knowledge, Americanism would seem to him to be a
hallucination, an article of faith supported only by our determination
to believe it, and to coerce others into believing it.
The secret of our uniformity would be a stubborn ignorance.</p>

<p>At which point our critic would have to re-examine his
earlier impressions about our “passion for education,” and
strive to understand the uses to which we actually put our
educational establishment, to appraise its function in our life.</p>

<p>Beginning with the kindergarten, it provides us a few hours’
relief from our responsibility toward our youngsters. Curiously,
the Americans most given to this evasion are the Americans
most inveterately sentimental about the “kiddies” and
most loath to employ the nursery system, holding it somehow
an undemocratic invasion of the child’s rights. Then somewhere
in the primary grades we begin to feel that we are purchasing
relief from the burden of fundamental instruction.
Ourselves mentally lazy, abstracted, and genuinely bewildered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
by the flow of questions from only one mouth, we blithely refer
that awakening curiosity to a harassed young woman, probably
less well informed than we are, who has to answer, or silence,
the questions of from a score to three score mouths. So begins
that long throttling of curiosity which later on will baffle
the college instructor, who will sometimes write a clever magazine
essay about the complacent ignorance of his pupils.</p>

<p>A few years, and our expectation has shifted to the main
chance. We begin worrying over grade reports and knotting
our brows over problems in arithmetic by way of assisting our
offspring to the practical advantages of education. For the
child, we now demand of his teachers solid and lasting preparation
in the things whose monetary value our office or domestic
payroll keeps sharply before us—figures, penmanship,
spelling, home economics. For us, the vicarious glory of his
“brightness.” But we want this brightness to count, to be in
the direct avenue to his career; so we reinforce the environment
that gently discourages him from the primrose paths of knowledge.
Nothing “practical” is too good for the boy at this moment—tool
chests, bicycles, wireless, what not. Thank God,
we can give him a better start than we had. As for arts and
letters, well, we guess what was good enough for his dad is good
enough for him. Meanwhile we are rather pleased than not at
the athletics and the other activities in which the grammar
school apes the high school that apes the college.</p>

<p>The long spiral of repetitive schooling in study and sport
has now commenced its climb: year by year reviews and adds
its fresh increment to last year’s subject-matter in the classroom
and on the field. Is it so strange that when the boy meets his
college professors he is cock-sure of knowing to a hair the limits
of what is normal and important in life, beyond which lie the
abnormal interests of the grinds? That mediocre <em>C</em> is a gentleman’s
mark? Not his to question the system that, in season
and out, has borne down on passing instead of on training, and
that ends somewhere, soon or late, with a diploma and, amid
family plaudits, graduation from family control.</p>

<p>The high schools are expected to fit ninety-five per cent. of
their charges for life and five per cent. for college. If our boy
and girl are of the ninety and five, we demand very early specialization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
toward their precious careers, wax enthusiastic over
the school’s model mercantile and banking establishment, expand
to know our children are being dosed with a course in
“Civics,” generously admire the history note-books in which
they have spread much tinted ink over a little stereotyped
information, and in what we fool ourselves into believing
are the margins to all these matters proudly watch them capture
a class numeral or a school letter, grumblingly pay for
real estate signs that have gone up in flame to celebrate some
epochal victory, and bear with their antics during hazings and
initiations. It’s a democratic country, and if the poor man’s
son cannot go to college, why the college must come to him.
Nor are we without a certain undemocratic satisfaction in the
thought that he has stolen a four years’ march into business
over the rich man’s son, who spends his college hours, we
assure ourselves, acquiring habits that will leave him weak in
the hour of competition.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the straddling masters are cramming the other
five with all the dates and rules and verbs and prose passages
which long and bitter experience has demonstrated to be likeliest
on entrance examinations. From the classrooms, as term
follows term with its endless iteration of short advances and
long reviews, there rises the bruit of rivalry: masters decorously
put forward the claims of their own colleges; pupils rejoice
when their future alma mater notches another athletic victory
to the well-remembered tally; the weak of heart are urging
upon their bewildered parents the superior merits of the
“back-door” route to some exacting university—by certificate
to a small college and transfer at the end of the first year.</p>

<p>There are high schools in whose cases all this is understatement;
and of course there are innumerable others, especially
in these days when the most rigorous colleges have lost
a little of their faith in entrance examinations, where it is
absurd overstatement. Nevertheless your son, if he goes to
a representative Eastern college from a representative high
school, goes as a man steals second in the seventh. And his
subsequent instructors marvel at the airy nonchalance with
which he ignores “the finer things of life”!</p>

<p>The private secondary schools, save those that are frankly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
designed to relieve parents of recalcitrant boys when the public
schools will have no more of them, are pretty much without
the ninety-five per cent. of non-college men. Frequently they
have their charges for longer periods. So they are free to
specialize in cramming with more singleness of mind and at
the same time to soften the process as their endowments and
atmospheres permit. But at bottom the demand you make of
the “prep school” is the same demand your bookkeeper puts
on his son’s high school: you want your boy launched into college
with the minimum of trouble for yourself and the maximum
of practical advantage for him; your bookkeeper wants his boy
launched into business with a minimum of frippery and a
maximum of marketable skill. One boy is experted into college,
the other is experted into business. You are both among
those passionate believers in education who impressed the Martian
on his first visit.</p>

<p>Some educator has announced that the college course should
not only provide preparation for life but should itself be a satisfactory
portion of life. What college student so dull as not
to know that? For the most part, he trusts the faculty to
provide the preparation—sometimes it would seem that he
dares it to—but he takes jolly good care that the four years
shall give him life more abundantly. He has looked forward
to them with an impatience not even the indignity of entrance
examinations could balk; he will live them to the top of his
bent; and he will look back on them tenderly, even sentimentally,
as the purplest patch of his days. So the American undergraduate
is representative of the American temper at its
best. He is the flower of our youth at its moment of perfect
bloom, its ideals not yet corrupted, its aspirations unwithered.
As he thinks and feels, all America would think and feel if it
dared and could.</p>

<p>At this point, therefore, the Martian’s inquiry into what we
expect from our educational establishment would have to shift
its point of view from the older to the younger generation.
The Martian would be much in demand at our colleges, both
as a sure-fire lecturer and as a shining target for degrees certain
to attract wide publicity to the donors. Let us imagine him
setting aside a page in his notebook for a scheme of undergraduate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
emphases, grouped and amended as his triumphant
progress permitted him to check up on his observations.</p>

<p>Athletics would of course head the list. Regarded as play—that
is, as they affect the spectator—college sports proffer a
series of thrilling Roman holidays extending from the first week
or so of term-time to the final base-ball game and crew race
of Commencement week the next June, and for some colleges
there may be transatlantic sequels in midsummer or later. It
is by no means all play for the spectator, whose loyalty to his
institution makes it his duty to watch the teams practise, follow
the histories of the gladiators who are at once his representatives
and his entertainers, and drill himself in songs and
yells at noisy mass meetings; to bet on his college according
to his purse and without any niggardly regard for his sober
judgment as to the event; then to deck himself in the colours,
march to the field, and watch the fray from the cheering section,
where his attention will be perpetually interrupted by the
orders and the abuse of a file of insatiable marionettes who
are there to dictate when he may and when he may not give
throat to his enthusiasm; and finally, if Providence please, to
be one of the snake-dancing celebrants of victory. If he have
the right physique or talent for one of the sports, he will find
himself conscripted by public opinion to enter upon the long
and arduous regimen that turns out the annual handful of
athletic heroes—to slave on freshman squads, class teams,
scrub and third and second teams, and finally perhaps, if he
has been faithful, to play a dull minute or two of a big game
that is already decided and so receive his coveted letter and
side-line privilege as a charity. Or at the dizziest pinnacle of
success, a “star,” to endure the unremitting discipline of summer
practice, incessant training, eating with his fellow-stars
at the training table, in season and out to be the butt of instruction
and exhortation from all the experts of the entourage.
As they affect the participant, then, college sports are to be
regarded as work that differs from the work of professional
sportsmen chiefly by being unremunerated.</p>

<p>The student’s next most vivid concern is the organization of
the social life in the academic commonwealth of which he is a
citizen. Every American college has, or fancies it has, its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
own tone, its ideal type of man; and good citizenship prescribes
conformity to the spirit of the place and observance of
the letter of its unwritten code. For the type is defined by a
body of obligations and taboos transmitted from generation to
generation, sometimes through the mouthpiece of the faculty,
sometimes by way of the college “Bible” (to use the slang
name for those handy manuals of what to do and what to avoid
which the college Y.M.C.A. issues for the guidance of newcomers),
but most often by a rough process of trial and error
which very speedily convinces the freshman that the Fence is
for seniors only, or that it is impracticable to smoke his pipe
in the Yard, or that it is much healthier to take the air in a
class cap than bareheaded. The cherished “traditions” of a
college are for the most part a composite of just such privileges
and prohibitions as these, clustering round the notion of the
type and symbolizing it; and, curiously, the younger the institution,
the more insistent it is likely to be about the sanctity
of its traditions—a college feels the need of a type in much
the same degree that a factory needs a trademark.</p>

<p>Conformity thus becomes an article in loyalty. Sometimes
the mere conformity is the desiderate virtue, as used (at least)
to be the case in Yale. Sometimes the type will go in for
individualism, as at Harvard a decade ago, where the thing to
conform to was non-conformity. One tradition is probably
universal: is there anywhere in America a college which does
not boast that it is more “democratic” than others? Democracy
undergoes some engaging redefinition in support of these
conflicting claims, but at bottom it refers to an absence of
snobs, arrogant critics, incomprehensible intellectuals, bouncing
wits, uncomfortable pessimists—in short, the discouragement
of just such individual tastes and energies as the Martian
found discouraged in our social life at large. The money line
remains. Theoretically, the poor may compete in athletics
and in other student enterprises and reap the same social rewards
as the rich: practically, they may compete and go socially
unrewarded, precisely as in the outside world. It is
natural and seemly that this should be the case, for the poor
cannot afford the avenues of association which are the breath
of society to the rich. There have been football heroes whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
the well-to-do have put in the way of acquiring wealth after
they left college, but this is patronage, not democracy. There
are also colleges proud to be known as poor men’s colleges, and
for that very reason devoid of the democracy they boast. Not
long ago the president of Valparaiso had to resign, and it developed
that among the counts against him were the deadly
facts that he had attended the annual alumni dinner in dress
clothes and had countenanced “dances, athletics, fraternities,
and such.” No, all that we really mean by democracy in college
is the equal opportunity to invest one’s inoffensive charm
and perfectly good money in a transient society, to be neighbourly
across geographical and family lines, to cultivate the
local twist of the universal ideal—to be a “regular fellow.”
Which is very much what we mean by democracy outside.
Whatever the precise type of man a college exalts, its characteristic
virtues are those that reflect a uniform people—hearty
acceptance of unexamined ideals, loyal conformity to
traditional standards and taboos, unassuming modesty in
“playing the game,” and a wholesome optimism withal.</p>

<p>But as for genuine democracy, the unrestricted interplay of
free spirits against a common background, what college can
boast that its social organization approaches even the measure
of equality enjoyed by its disinterested scholars? There was
a modicum of it in the free elective system that obtained in Dr.
Eliot’s Harvard. There was an indifference to seniority that
sorely puzzled the graduates of other colleges. Alas, freshman
dormitories descended upon it, treacherously carrying the
banners of “democracy”; and a “group system” of courses
began to externalize intellectual interests to which the elective
system, abused as it was, had offered every opportunity for
spontaneity. It may be that the Amherst of Dr. Meiklejohn’s
experiments, or the Smith that President Neilson envisages, will
recapture opportunities now fled from Cambridge. These
cases, after all, are exceptional. For the typical American
college, private or public, marshals its students in two caste
systems so universal and so familiar that it never occurs to us
to scrutinize the one and we are liable to criticize the other
only when its excesses betray its decadence.</p>

<p>The former, the divisioning and tagging of every recruit with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
the year of his graduation, looks to be an innocent convenience
until you have surveyed its regimental effect. Freshmen are
green; so we clap ridiculous caps on them, dub them “Frosh”
or “Fish,” haze them, confine them to a York Street of their
kind or impound them in freshman dormitories, where we bid
them save themselves, the which they do in their sophomore
year at the expense of the next crop of recruits. It is not so
much the occasional brutality of hazing parties and “rushes”
that should arrest us here, nor yet such infrequent accidents as
the probably insane despair of that Harvard freshman whose
phobia for eggs drove him to suicide to escape the inflexible
diet of his class commons, as it is the remorseless mob invasion
of personality and privacy which either leaves the impressionable
boy a victim of his ingrowing sensibility or else converts
him into a martinet who in his turn will cripple others.
In the case of the Cornell freshman who was ducked for stubbornly
refusing to wear the class cap and was saved from
more duckings by an acting president who advised him—“in
all friendliness,” said the newspapers!—to submit or to withdraw
from college for a year, it is not necessary to applaud
what may have been pig-headedness in the victim, or to flay
what may have been wisdom in the executive, in order to admire
the single professor who stood ready to resign in order to
rebuke his college for her bigotry. What was really significant
here, however, and what is everywhere characteristic of this
sort of benevolent assimilation, was the tone of the university
daily’s editorial apologia:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Complete liberty of action has never been recognized by any but
avowed anarchists; granted the validity of the law, there can be no
charge of intolerance in the enforcement of it.”</p>
</div>

<p>The legal “validity” of an arbitrary tradition! No “intolerance”
in its enforcement by Judge Lynch! The editor of
the <cite>Cornell Sun</cite> went on to say that the existence of the “law”
in question is “no secret from the prospective Cornellian,” implying,
no doubt, that to offer oneself for matriculation at Cornell
is <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ipso facto</i> to accept the whole body of Ithacan tradition
and taboos, along with their interpretation and enforcement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
according to the momentary caprice of the majority, as a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">contrat
social</i>. Small wonder he called the refractory freshman
a “red.” The young editor’s reasoning should recommend his
early appointment to a place in the greater <i>Sun</i>.</p>

<p>The caste system of academic seniority, like all caste systems,
is worst at its base. Such customs as the sequestering
of the upper classes in their private quads or ovals, the jealous
protection of senior privileges, and the calendrical elaboration
of the alumni programme serve to import a picturesque
if rather forced variety into our drab monotony. That men
should choose to organize themselves to protect some more or
less irrelevant distinction is of no special importance to outsiders
so long as they do not use their organization to dragoon
minorities or to bully individuals. Yet, speak out against
the exploitation, and you will be accused of attacking the fellowship.
Criticize the shackling of freshmen, and there will
not be wanting college editors to call you a fanatic who cannot
bear the jolly sight of cap and gown.</p>

<p>The other system of caste, to which we give sharp attention
when it goes badly wrong, is of course the club hierarchy.
Wherever there are clubs their social capital will necessarily
fluctuate with the quality of the members they take in. The
reformers who deplore the institution of “rushing” have of
course exaggerated its evils, but the evils are there. In young
colleges, and wherever clubs are insecure, the candidates are
liable to be spoiled for any club purposes before their destination
is settled; wherever the candidates must do the courting,
either brazenly or subtly, they tend to debauch the club. The
dilemma holds, in one form or another, all the way from the
opposed “literary” societies of the back-woods college to the
most powerful chapters of the national fraternities; and it is
particularly acute where the clubhouse is also the student’s
residence. Any remedy thus far advanced by the reformers
is worse than the disease.</p>

<p>In many of the older colleges the equilibrium has been
stabilized by a device similar to the gentlemen’s agreement in
industry. The important clubs have gradually adjusted themselves
into a series through which the clubman passes, or into
which he penetrates as far as his personality and money will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
carry him. So the initial competition for untried material is
done away with or greatly simplified; one or two large freshman
or sophomore clubs take in all the likely candidates; the
junior clubs do most of their choosing from among this number;
and the senior clubs in turn draw on the junior. Meanwhile
the member turnover is perhaps trebled, and initiations
and other gay functions multiply.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered, however, that not all the brethren
shift onward and upward year by year. Many have to content
themselves with clubs already won, and those who pass
on are a narrowing band, whose depleted ranks are by no
means restored in the eleventh hour recruiting of “elections
at large,” deathbed gestures of democracy after a career of
ballotting to exclude candidates who had not taken all the
earlier degrees. Thus increasing distinction is purchased
through the tried and true method of decreasing numbers. To
be sure, the same end could be served if all would remain in
one club and periodically drop groups of the least likely members.
Initiations might be reversed, and punches be given to
celebrate the lightening of the ship: it would be no more fantastic
than a good part of the existing ceremonial. But—it
would be undemocratic! And, too, the celebrations might be
fatally hilarious. The present pre-initiation discipline is one
that tests for regularity and bestows the accolade on the inconspicuous,
so that the initiates turn out pretty much of a piece
and the entertainment they provide is safely conventional. But
reverse the process, assemble in one squad all the hands suspected
of being exceptional—all the queer fish and odd sticks—and
there’s no predicting what capers they might cut as they
walked the plank.</p>

<p>The real evil of the club caste is its taste for predictability,
its standardization of contacts, its faintly cynical sophistication
where life might be a riot of adventures and experiments
and self-discoveries—in one word, its respectability. Not that
it does not provide much good fellowship and a great deal of
fun (including the varieties that have distressed its moral
critics). But that everything it provides is so definitely provided
<em>for</em>, so institutionalized, and so protected from the enrichment
different types and conditions of men could bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
to it that it is exclusive in a more sinister sense than the one
intended by the critics of its alleged snobbery.</p>

<p>Normally the club system is by no means so snobbish as
it is thought to be; it dislikes, and is apt to punish with the
black ball, the currying of social favour and the parade of
special privilege. For youth is youth, and in the last analysis
the enemy of caste. It is the glory of college life that the
most unexpected friendships will overleap the fences run by
class and club regimentation. It is its pity that the fences,
which yield so easily to irregular friendships once they have
discovered themselves, should nevertheless be stout enough to
herd their victims past so many unrecognized opportunities
for spontaneous association. The graduate who looks back
fondly on his halcyon days is very likely passing over the
Senior Picnic and his row of shingles to recall haze-hung October
afternoons of tobacco and lazy reminiscence on the window-seat
of somebody who got nowhere in class or club, or is
wistful for the midnight arguments he had with that grind who
lived in his entry freshman year—nights alive with darting
speculation and warm with generous combat. Of these clandestine
sweets he will say nothing; he is a regular fellow; but
he affords one of the proofs that the well-worn social channels
are not deep enough to carry off all the wine of free fellowship.
And that even the moderate caste of college, securely established
as it seems, must defend itself from youth (even from
its own youth!) is demonstrated by two phenomena not to be
explained satisfactorily on any other hypothesis. What is all
the solemn mummery, the preposterous ritual, the pompous
processions to and from temples of nightmare architecture, the
whole sacrosanct edifice of the secret fraternities, if it be not
an embroidery wherewith to disguise from present and future
devotees the naked matter-of-factness of the cult? And, on the
other hand, what are the too early maturity, the atmosphere
of politely blasé languor, the ubiquitous paraphernalia for
comfort and casual hospitality that characterize the non-secret
and citified clubs of the “indifferent” college but so many
disarming confessions of the predictability of everything—the
predictability, and the necessity for quiet acceptance? Under
all the encouraging variations and exceptions runs the regimental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
command of our unanimity: if you are to belong, you
must conform; you must accept the limits of the conventional
world for the bounds of your reality; and then, according to
the caprice of your <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">genius loci</i>, you will play the game as if
everything, even the minutiæ of the ritual your club has inherited
from freer spirits, were of tremendous moment, or you
will play it no less thoroughly but with the air of one who
knows that nothing is of any moment at all. The clubs, that
have so often been criticized for their un-American treason
to democracy, are only too loyally American.</p>

<p>The third emphasis would be corollary to these two—the
political management of athletic and class and club affairs.
The politics are those of personal popularity, the management
is that of administration rather than legislation, the spirit is
the American flair for petty regulation. Where issues are in
question the tone is almost certain to be propagandist, conservatives
and radicals dividing a field littered with hard names.
College life has accumulated an abundance of machinery for
the expression of the managing instinct, and most of it works.
Nowadays the lines of representation finally knot in a Student
Council, which is at once the Cabinet, the Senate, and the
Supreme Court of the undergraduate commonwealth. The
routine of its work is heavily sumptuary, and such matters as
the sizes and colours and seasons for hatband insignia, the
length of time students may take off to attend a distant game,
the marshalling of parades, are decided with taste and tact.
Then, abruptly, it is a tribunal for major cases, just if severe:
a class at Yale fails to observe the honour rule, and upon
the Council’s recommendation twenty-one students are expelled
or suspended; it was the Student Council at Valparaiso that
secured the president’s withdrawal; and at Cornell it was the
Student Council that came to the rescue of tradition when a
freshman refused to wear the freshman cap. Invariably, one
concludes, its edicts and verdicts will support righteousness, as
its constituents understand righteousness.</p>

<p>The constituents themselves are ordinarily on the side of
light, as they see the light. Not so long ago the faculty of
a small New England college decided to dispense with compulsory
chapel: the students voted it back. Moral crusades<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
spring up like mushrooms and command the allegiance of all
but the recalcitrant “rough-necks,” whom student opinion is
sometimes tempted to feel are beating their way through an
education for which they make no equivalent return in public
spirit. A typical campaign of the sort was recently put in
motion by the student daily at Brown: the editors discovered
that “the modern age of girls and young men is intensely
immoral”; they penned sensational editorials that evoked
column-long echoes in the metropolitan press; they raised a
crusade against such abominations as petting parties, the toddle
(“Rome,” they wrote, “toddled before it fell”), and “parties
continued until after breakfast time”; almost immediately
they won a victory—the Mothers’ Club of Providence resolved
that dances for children must end by eleven o’clock....</p>

<p>And now the undergraduate will emphasize study. But a
sharp line must be drawn between study that looks forward
merely to the A.B. degree as the end of schooling and the
beginning of business, and study that is a part of professional
training, that looks forward to some professional degree at
Commencement or to matriculation in a graduate school. Both
come under the head of preparation for life; but in the former
case the degree itself is the preparation, whereas in the latter
case it is recognized that one must master and retain at least
a working modicum of the subject-matter of the professional
courses and of the liberal courses preliminary to them.</p>

<p>The arts man, then, recognizes only the same necessity he
has faced all the way up the school ladder—to pass. If he
have entrance conditions, they are mortgages that must be paid
off, perhaps in the Summer School; he must keep off probation
to protect his athletic or political or other activity status; beyond
this, he must garner enough courses and half-courses,
semester hours or points, to purchase the indispensable sheepskin.
Further effort is supererogatory so far as concerns study
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">per se</i>: prizes and distinctions fall in the category of “student
activities,” hobbies, and belong of right to the “sharks”;
scholarships, which in America are for the poor only, have to
do with still another matter—earning one’s way through—and
are mostly reserved for the “paid marks men,” professional
studiers, grinds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>

<p>Upon his programme of courses the student will often expend
as much mental energy as would carry him through an ordinary
examination: he will pore over the catalogue, be zealous to
avoid nine o’clocks and afternoon hours liable to conflict with
games, make an elaborate survey of the comparative competence
of instructors, both as graders and as entertainers and
even (quaintly enough) as experts in their fields, and enquire
diligently after snap courses. Enrolled in a course, he will
speedily estimate the minimum effort that will produce a safe
pass, unless the subject happens to be one that commends itself
to his interest independently of academic necessity. In that
case he will exceed not only the moderate stint calculated to
earn a <em>C</em>, but sometimes even the instructor’s extravagant requirements.
There is, in fact, scarcely a student but has at
least one pet course in which he will “eat up” all the required
reading and more, take gratuitous notes, ask endless questions,
and perhaps make private sallies into research. The fact that
he holds most of this labour to be self-indulgence will not temper
his indignation if he fails to “pull” an <em>A</em> or <em>B</em>, though it
is a question whether, when the grade has sealed the course,
he will be much the wiser for it than for the others.</p>

<p>On the evils of the course system there is probably no new
thing to be said. Such devices as the “group system” at Harvard
interfere with liberty of election without appreciably correcting
the graduate’s ignorance of the courses he has passed
and cashed in for his degree. Recognizing this fact, certain
faculties have latterly inaugurated general examinations in the
whole subject-matter studied under one department, as notably
in History, Government, and Economics; but thus far the general
examination affects professional preparation, as notably for
the Law School, much more than it affects the straight arts
career, where it provides just one more obstacle to “pass.”</p>

<p>This business of passing is a seasonal nuisance. The early
weeks of term-time are an Arcady of fetching lectures, more or
less interesting assigned reading, and abundant “cuts.” Across
the smiling sky float minatory wisps of cloud—exercises,
quizzes, tests. Then up from the horizon blow the “hour
exams,” first breath of the academic weather that later on will
rock the earth with “mid-years” and “finals.” But to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
forewarned is, for the prudent student, to get armed, and
Heaven knows he is amply warned by instructor, registrar, and
dean. So he hies himself to the armourer, the tutor, one of the
brotherhood of experts who saw him through the entrance examinations;
he provides himself with bought or leased notebooks
and summaries; he crams through a few febrile nights
of cloistral deprivations and flagellations; and the sun shines
again on his harvest of gentlemen’s <em>C</em>’s, the proud though superfluous
<em>A</em> or <em>B</em>, and maybe a <em>D</em> that bespeaks better armour
against the next onset. Or, of course, he may have slipped
into “probation,” limbo that outrageously handicaps his athletic
or political ambitions. Only if he have been a hapless
probationer before the examinations is there any real risk of
his having to join the exceedingly small company of living
sacrifices whom a suddenly austere college now “rusticates.”
(For in America suspensions and expulsions are the penalties
rather of irregular conduct than of mental incompetence or
sloth.) In four years, after he has weathered a score of these
storms and concocted a few theses, the president hands him
a diploma to frame, he sells his other furniture, puts mothballs
in his cap and gown, and plunges into business to overtake
his non-college competitors.</p>

<p>Student opinion recognizes that the man enrolled in professional
courses or headed for a graduate school faces more
stringent necessities. He may devote himself to his more specific
training without the imputation of being a “grind,” and
if he pursues honours it will be in the line of business rather
than of indoor sport. He will be charier of cuts, more painstaking
as regards his notes and reading, and the professional
manner will settle on him early. In every college commons you
can find a table where the talk is largely shop—hypothetical
cases, laboratory experiments, new inventions, devices for circumventing
the income tax. All this, however, is really a quantitative
difference, not a qualitative. Of disinterested intellectual
activity he is if anything more innocent than his fellow
in the arts school.</p>

<p>So much for the four great necessities of average student life—in
order of acknowledged importance: athletics, social life,
politics, study. Deans and other official but theoretical folk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
will tell our Martian that the business of college is study and
that all the undergraduate’s other functions are marginal matters;
but their own conduct will already have betrayed them
to him, for he will not have missed the fact that most of their
labour is devoted to making study as dignified and popular as
the students have made sports and clubs and elections. These
four majors hold their places at the head of the list of student
emphases because no representative undergraduate quite escapes
any of them; the next ones may be stressed more variously,
according rather to the student’s capricious private inclinations
than to his simpler group reactions.</p>

<p>Now, for instance, he is free to “go in for” some of the
innumerable “student activities,” avocations as opposed to the
preceding vocations. There are the minor sports which are not
so established in popularity that they may conscript players—lacrosse,
association football, trap shooting, swimming, and so
on. There are the other intercollegiate competitions—chess
and debating and what not. The musical clubs, the dramatic
clubs, the magazines, and many semi-professional and semi-social
organizations offer in their degree more or less opportunity
to visit rival institutions. Then, too, there is in the
larger colleges a club for almost every religious cult, from
Catholic to Theosophist, whose devotees may crave a closer
warmth of communion than they realize in the chapel, which
is ordinarily non-sectarian; a club apiece for some of the great
fraternal orders; a similar club for each of the political parties,
to say nothing of a branch of the Intercollegiate Socialist
Society, with another organization forming to supply the colleges
with associated Liberal Clubs. Moreover, all the important
preparatory schools, private and public, are certain to be
represented by clubs of their alumni, some of which maintain
scholarships but all of which do yeoman service scouting for
athletes. Frequently there is a Cosmopolitan Club for foreign
students and travelled Americans. And, finally, there are
clubs to represent the various provinces of knowledge—the
classics, philosophy, mathematics, the various sciences, and so
on indefinitely. Then, in colleges in or near cities, there are
well-organized opportunities for students who care to make a
hobby of the Uplift and go in for social service. While, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
amateur and professional sharks and grinds, there is the honour
roll of prizes, scholarships, fellowships, distinctions, and other
academic honours. Verily a paradise for the joiner. Day by
day, the calendar of meetings and events printed in the university
paper resembles nothing so much as the bulletin board
of a metropolitan hotel which caters to conventions.</p>

<p>If at first glance all this welter of endeavour looks to be anything
but evidence of uniformity, at second will appear its significant
principle. Every part of it is cemented together by a
universal institutionalizing of impulses and values. There is
scarcely a college activity which can serve for a hobby but
has its shingle and ribbon and certificated niche in the undergraduate
régime.</p>

<p>Even the undergraduate’s extra-collegiate social life, which
would probably stand next on the Martian’s list, is thoroughly
regimented. Speaking broadly, it is incorrect to call on girls
at the nearest girls’ college; and, speaking still more broadly,
there is usually one correct college whereat it is socially incumbent
to pay devoirs. In coeducational institutions the sex
line is an exacting but astonishingly innocent consumer of time
and energy, of which the greater part is invested in the sheer
maintenance of convention. Along both these social avenues
the student practises a mimicry of what seems to him to be the
forms regnant in secular society and, intent on the forms, tends
to miss by a little what neighbourly ease really exists there, so
that he out-conventionalizes the conventional world. The non-college
American youth, of both sexes, would scarcely tolerate
the amount of formalism, chaperonage, and constraint that
our college youth voluntarily assumes.</p>

<p>The word “fussing” is the perfect tag for the visiting, the
taking to games and dances, the cherishing at house-parties,
and the incessant letter-writing that are the approved communications
across the sex line. You make a fuss over a girl,
and there it ends; or you make a fuss over a girl and get
engaged, and there it ends; or—and this is frequent only in the
large Western universities where well-nigh all the personable
youths of the State’s society are in college together—you make
a fuss over a girl, you get engaged, and in due time you get
married. So far as fussing is concerned, sex is far more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
decorous among collegians than among their non-collegiate fellows
of the same ages and social levels. There is a place, of
course, where it is indecorous enough; but that place is next
on the Martian’s list.</p>

<p>Which now shifts its weakening emphasis to recreation.
You will have thought that most of the foregoing attached to
recreation and that all play and no work is the undergraduate
rule. You will have erred. Above this point almost everything
on the list is recognized by the student to be in some sort
an obligation, a serious concern, a plough on which he finds his
hand gently laid by custom but which he cannot decently relinquish
till he has gained the end of the furrow.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Nobody could be busier than the normal undergraduate. His
team, his paper, his club, show, or other activity, sometimes several
at once, occupy every spare moment which he can persuade the
office to let him take from the more formal part of college instruction.”</p>
</div>

<p>The quotation is not from a baccalaureate sermon: it is from
the Harvard class oration of 1921.</p>

<p>The prime relaxation is talk, infinite talk—within its local
range, full of tang, flicking with deft satire the rumps of
pompous asses, burlesquing the comic (that is, the abnormal)
in campus situations, making of gossip a staccato criticism—and
beyond that range, a rather desultory patter about professional
sport, shows, shallow books, the froth of fashion, all
treated lightly but taken with what a gravity! For the other
relaxations there are, according to taste, the theatre of girls
and music, the novel, bath-robed sessions at poker and bridge,
late afternoon tennis or golf or handball (very nearly the only
sports left to play for their own sake), and the bouts with
Bacchus and Venus which, though they attract fewer college
men than non-college men, are everywhere the moral holidays
that insure our over-driven Puritanism against collapse.</p>

<p>A favourite subject for college debates and Freshman
themes argues the case for and against going to college. You
could listen to scores of such debates, read thousands of such
themes, without once meeting a clear brief for education as a
satisfaction of human curiosity. Everywhere below the level<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
of disinterested scholarship, education is regarded as access to
that body of common and practical information without which
one’s hands and tongue will be tied in the company of one’s
natural peers. “Institutions of learning,” as the National Security
League lately advised the Vice-President of the United
States, “are established primarily for the dissemination of
knowledge, which is acquaintance with fact and not with
theory.” Consequently the universal expectation of the educational
establishment has little to do with any wakening of
appropriate if differing personalities, and has everything to
do with a standard patina, varying only in its lustre, its brighter
or duller reflection of the established scene.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the essential Adam does break through and
quiz the scene. Though it come lowest in his scale of emphasis,
the typical underclassman knows the qualms and hungers
of curiosity, experiments a little with forbidden fruit, at some
time fraternizes with a man of richer if disreputable experience,
perhaps strikes up a wistful friendship with a sympathetic instructor.
Then the world of normal duties and rewards and
certainties closes round him, and security in it becomes his
first concern. Sometime he intends really to read, to think
long thoughts again, to go to the bottom of things. Meanwhile
he falls into the easy habit of applying such words as “radical”
or “highbrow” to those infrequent hardier spirits who
continue restless and unappeased. Later in life you will catch
him explaining that radicalism is a perfectly natural manifestation
of adolescence and the soundest foundation for mature
conservatism. Wise churchmen still talk that way about religious
doubt, and bide their time, and later refer to the “death
of doubt”—which has really been buried alive. The Martian
would conclude that the function of terrestrial education is to
bury curiosity alive.</p>

<p>But could he now feel that this educational establishment,
this going machine of assimilation, is responsible for our
uniformity? Will not American school and college life now
seem too perfect a reflection of American adult life to be its
parent? Everything in that scale of college values, from
the vicarious excitements of football to what Santayana
has called the “deprivations of disbelief” has its exact analogue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
in our life at large; and neither any college tradition nor
yet the “genteel tradition” is of so much significance as the
will to tradition that both reveal. The Martian will long since
have suspected himself guilty of a very human error, that of
getting the cart before the horse.</p>

<p>For we have made our schools in our own image. They
are not our prisons, but our homes. Every now and again
we discipline a rash instructor who carries too far his private
taste for developing originality; we pass acts that require
teachers to sink their own differences in our unanimity; and
our fatuous faith in the public school system as the “cradle of
liberty” rests on the political control we exercise over it. Far
from being the dupes of education, we ourselves dupe the educated;
and that college men do not rebel is due to the fact
that inside a world our uniformity dominates as easily as it
dominates the school, the regimen works, college men really
do get ahead, and the “queer” really are frustrate.</p>

<p>Then, what is the origin of our “desperate need to agree”?
There is a possible answer in our history, if only we can be
persuaded to give our history a little attention. When we became
a nation we were not a folk. We were, in fact, so far
from being alike that there were only our common grievances
and a few propositions on which we could be got together at
all, and the propositions were more like stubborn articles of
faith than like tested observations: “We hold these truths to
be self-evident, that all men are created equal ... certain
inalienable Rights ... Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness
... the consent of the governed ... are, and of
Right ought to be, Free and Independent States.” That is not
the tone of men who are partakers in a common tradition and
who share reasonable and familiar convictions. Thus under
the spur of our first national necessity we gave the first evidence
of our capacity to substitute an arbitrary and not too
exacting lowest common denominator to which men can subscribe,
for the natural and rigorous highest common multiple
that expresses their genuine community of interest. The device
succeeded because we succeeded, but it was the propositions
that got the credit. The device has continued to succeed
ever since for the same reason that tradition succeeds in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
the modern college—nobody who has had any reason to challenge
the propositions has been able to get at us.</p>

<p>Our proper job was to create a people, to get acquainted
with each other and develop a common background. But the
almost miraculous success of our lowest common denominator
stood in the way of our working out any highest common multiple.
Instead of developing a common background, we went
on assimilating subscribers to the Declaration, our arbitrary
tradition, “Americanism.” We have been so increasingly beset
by aliens who had to be assimilated that their Americanization
has prevented our own.</p>

<p>We now believe our national job was the Conquest of the
West, as if scattering people over a continent were any substitute
for creating a People. But we have never been seriously
challenged. If our good luck should hold, the second
or third generation after us will believe our job was the subjugation
of a hemisphere, including the assimilation of genuine
peoples who have done us less harm even than the Indians
did. But, whatever our practice, we shall never admit that
our theory has altered. Still lacking any common background,
we shall still enclose ourselves against the void in the painted
scene of our tradition.</p>

<p>But our luck may not hold. We may be challenged yet.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_INTELLECTUAL_LIFE">THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">When</span> Professor Einstein roused the ire of the women’s
clubs by stating that “women dominate the entire life
of America,” and that “there are cities with a million population,
but cities suffering from terrible poverty—the poverty
of intellectual things,” he was but repeating a criticism of our
life now old enough to be almost a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cliché</i>. Hardly any intelligent
foreigner has failed to observe and comment upon the
extraordinary feminization of American social life, and oftenest
he has coupled this observation with a few biting remarks
concerning the intellectual anæmia or torpor that seems to
accompany it. Naturally this attitude is resented, and the
indiscreet visitor is told that he has been rendered astigmatic
by too limited observation. He is further informed that he
should travel in our country more extensively, see more people,
and live among us longer. The inference is that this
chastening process will in due time acquaint him with a beauty
and a thrilling intellectual vitality coyly hidden from the superficial
impressionist.</p>

<p>Now the thesis of this paper is that the spontaneous judgment
of the perceptive foreigner is to a remarkable degree correct.
But it is a judgment which has to be modified in certain
respects rather sharply. Moreover, even long residence
in the United States is not likely to give a visitor as vivid a
sense of the historical background that has so largely contributed
to the present situation as is aroused in the native
American, who in his own family hears the folklore of the two
generations preceding him and to whom the pioneer tradition
is a reality more imaginatively plausible than, say, the emanations
of glory from English fields or the aura of ancient pomp
enwrapping an Italian castle. The foreigner is too likely to
forget that in a young country, precisely because it is young,
traditions have a social sanction unknown in an older country
where memory of the past goes so far back as to become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
shadowy and unreal. It is a paradox of history that from
ancient cultures usually come those who “were born too soon,”
whereas from young and groping civilizations spring the panoplied
defenders of conventions. It is usually when a tradition
is fresh that it is respected most; it is only when it has been
followed for years sufficient to make it meaningless that it can
create its repudiators. America is a very young country—and
in no respect younger than that of all Western nations it has
the oldest form of established government; our naïve respect
for the fathers is surest proof that we are still in the cultural
awkward age. We have not sufficiently grown up but that
we must still cling to our father and mother. In a word, we
still <em>think</em> in pioneer terms, whatever the material and economic
facts of a day that has already outgrown their applicability.</p>

<p>And it is the pioneer point of view, once thoroughly understood,
which will most satisfactorily explain the peculiar development
of the intellectual life in the United States. For
the life of the mind is no fine flower of impoverishment, and
if the beginnings of human reflection were the wayward reveries
of seamen in the long watches of the night or of a shepherd
lying on his back idly watching the summer clouds float
past, as surely have the considered intellectual achievements of
modern men been due to the commercial and industrial organization
which, whether or not conducive to the general happiness,
has at least made leisure possible for the few. But in
the pioneer community leisure cannot exist, even for the few;
the struggle is too merciless, the stake—life itself, possibly—too
high. The pioneer must almost of necessity hate the
thinker, even when he does not despise thought in itself, because
the thinker is a liability to a community that can afford
only assets; he is non-productive in himself and a dangerously
subversive example to others. Of course, the pioneer will
tolerate the minister, exactly as primitive tribes tolerated medicine
men—and largely for the same reasons. The minister,
if he cannot bring rain or ward off pestilence as the medicine
man at least pretended he could, can soften the hardness of
the human lot and can show the road to a future kingdom
that will amply compensate for the drudgery of the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
world. He has, in brief, considerable utilitarian value. The
thinker <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">per se</i>, however, has none; not only that, he is a reproach
and a challenge to the man who must labour by the
sweat of his brow—it is as if he said, “For what end, all this
turmoil and effort, merely to live? But do you know if life
is worth while on such terms?” Questions like these the
pioneer must cast far from him, and for the very good reason
that if they were tolerated, new communities might never become
settled. Scepticism is an expensive luxury possible only
to men in cities living off the fruit of others’ toil. Certainly
America, up to the end of the reconstruction period following
the Civil War, had little practical opportunity and less native
impulse for the cultivation of this tolerant attitude towards
ultimate values, an atmosphere which is a talisman that a true
intellectual life is flourishing.</p>

<p>Consider the terrible hardness of the pioneer’s physical life.
I can think of no better description of it than in one of Sherwood
Anderson’s stories, “Godliness,” in his book, “Winesburg,
Ohio.” He is writing of the Bentley brothers just before
the Civil War: “They clung to old traditions and worked
like driven animals. They lived as practically all of the
farming people of the time lived. In the spring and through
most of the winter the highways leading into the town of
Winesburg were a sea of mud. The four young men of the
family worked hard all day in the fields, they ate heavily of
coarse, greasy food, and at night slept like tired beasts on beds
of straw. Into their lives came little that was not coarse and
brutal, and outwardly they were themselves coarse and brutal.”
Naturally, this intense concentration upon work is not the
whole of the picture; there was gaiety and often there was
romance in the early days of pioneering, it ran like a coloured
thread through all the story of our <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Drang nach Westen</i>. But
on the whole the period from our confederation into a Union
until the expanding industrial era following the Civil War—roughly
the century from 1783 to 1883—was a period in which
the cardinal command was, “Be active, be bold, and above all,
work.” In that century we subdued and populated a continent.
There was no time for the distractions of art or the
amenities of literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

<p>To be sure, a short-range perspective seems to belie this last
generalization. The colonial times and the first part of the
19th century witnessed a valid and momentous literary and
intellectual efflorescence, and it was then we contributed many
names to the biography of greatness. Yet it was a culture
centred almost wholly in New England and wholly East of
the Alleghanies; it had its vitality because it was not self-conscious,
it was frankly derivative from England and Europe,
it made no pretensions to being intrinsically American. The
great current of our national life went irresistibly along,
ploughing, and tilling, and cutting down the trees and brush,
making roads and bridges as it filled the valleys and the plains.
That was the real America, a mighty river of life, compared
with which, for instance, Emerson and the Transcendentalists
seemed a mere backwater—not a stagnant or brackish one to
be sure, often a pool of quietude in which the stars, like Emerson’s
sentences, might be reflected. But the real America
was still in the heart of the pioneer. And in one sense, it
still is to-day.</p>

<p>The “real America,” I say, because I mean the America of
mind and attitude, the inner truth, not the outer actuality.
That outer actuality has made the fact of the pioneer almost
grotesque. The frontier is closed; the nation is the most
prosperous among the harassed ones of the earth; there is no
need for the old perpetual preoccupation with material existence.
In spite of trade depressions and wars and their aftermaths,
we have conquered that problem. But we have not
conquered ourselves. We must still go on in the old terms, as
if the purpose of making money in order to make more money
were as important as the purpose of raising bread in order
to support life. The facts have changed, but we have not
changed, only deflected our interests. Where the pioneer
cleared a wilderness, the modern financier subdues a forest of
competitors. He puts the same amount of energy and essentially
the same quality of thought into his task to-day, although
the practical consequences can hardly be described as identical.</p>

<p>And what have been those practical consequences? As the
industrial revolution expanded, coincidently with the filling up
of the country, the surplus began to grow. That surplus was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
expended not towards the enrichment of our life—if one omit
the perfunctory bequests for education—but towards the most
obvious of unnecessary luxuries, the grandiose maintenance
of our women. The daughters of pioneer mothers found
themselves without a real job, often, indeed, the chief instrument
for advertising their husbands’ incomes. For years the
Victorian conception of women as ornaments dominated what
we were pleased to call our “better elements”—those years,
to put it brutally, which coincided with that early prosperity
that made the conception possible. If the leisure of the landed
gentry class of colonial times had been other than a direct
importation, if there had ever been a genuine <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i> in our
cultural history, or if our early moneyed aristocracy had ever
felt itself really secure from the constant challenge of immigrant
newcomers, this surplus might have gone towards the
deepening and widening of what we could have felt to be an
indigenous tradition. Or if, indeed, the Cavalier traditions
of the South (the only offshoot of the Renaissance in America)
had not been drained of all vitality by the Civil War and its
economic and intellectual consequences, this surplus might
have enhanced the more gracious aspects of those traditions.
None of these possibilities existed; and when prosperity smiled
on us we were embarrassed. We were parvenus—even to this
day the comic series, “Bringing Up Father,” has a native
tang. We know exactly how Mr. Jiggs feels when Mrs. Jiggs
drags him away to a concert and makes him dress for a stiff,
formal dinner, when all his heart desires is to smoke his pipe
and play poker with Dinty and the boys. Indeed, this series,
which appears regularly in all the newspapers controlled by
Mr. Hearst, will repay the social historian all the attention he
gives it. It symbolises better than most of us appreciate the
normal relationship of American men and women to cultural
and intellectual values. Its very grotesqueness and vulgarity
are revealing.</p>

<p>In no country as in the United States have the tragic consequences
of the lack of any common concept of the good life
been so strikingly exemplified, and in no country has the break
with those common concepts been so sharp. After all, when
other colonies have been founded, when other peoples have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
roved from the homeland and settled in distant parts, they have
carried with them more than mere scraps of tradition. Oftenest
they have carried the most precious human asset of all, a
heritage of common feeling, which enabled them to cling to
the substance of the old forms even while they adapted them
to the new conditions of life. But with us the repudiation of
the old heritages was complete; we deliberately sought a new
way of life, for in the circumstances under which we came into
national being, breaking with the past was synonymous with
casting off oppression. The hopefulness, the eagerness, the
enthusiasm of that conscious attempt to adjudge all things
afresh found its classic expression in the eloquent if vague.
Declaration of Independence, not even the abstract phraseology
of which could hide the revolutionary fervour beneath.
Yet a few short years and that early high mood of adventure
had almost evaporated, and men were distracted from the
former vision by the prospect of limitless economic expansion,
both for the individual and the nation as a whole. The Declaration
symbolized only a short interlude in the pioneer spirit
which brought us here and then led us forth to conquer the
riches nature, with her fine contempt of human values, so
generously spread before us. The end of the revolutionary
mood came as soon as the signing of the Constitution by the
States, that admirable working compromise in government
which made no attempt to underscore democracy, as we understand
it to-day, but rather to hold it in proper check and
balance. Free, then, of any common heritage or tradition
which might question his values, free, also, of the troublesome
idealism of the older revolutionary mood, the ordinary man
could go forth into the wilderness with singleness of purpose.
He could be, as he still is to-day, the pioneer <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">toujours</i>.</p>

<p>Now when his success in his half-chosen rôle made it unnecessary
for him to play it, it was precisely the lack of a
common concept of the good life which made it impossible for
him to be anything else. It is not that Americans make money
because they love to do so, but because there is nothing else
to do; oddly enough, it is not even that the possessive instincts
are especially strong with us (I think the French, for instance,
are naturally more avaricious than we), but that we have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
notion of a definite type of life for which a small income is
enough, and no notion of any type of life from which work has
been consciously eliminated. Never in any national sense
having had leisure, as individuals we do not know what to do
with it when good fortune gives it to us. Unlike a real game,
we must go on playing <em>our</em> game even after we have won.</p>

<p>But if the successful pioneer did not know what to do with
his own leisure, he had naïve faith in the capacity of his
women to know what to do with theirs. With the chivalric
sentimentality that often accompanies the prosperity of the
primitive, the pioneer determined that his good luck should
bestow upon his wife and sisters and mother and aunts a gift,
the possession of which slightly embarrassed himself. He
gave them leisure exactly as the typical business man of to-day
gives them a blank check signed with his name. It
disposed of them, kept them out of his world, and salved his
conscience—like a check to charity. Unluckily for him, his
mother, his wife, his sisters, and his aunts were of his own
blood and breeding; they were the daughters of pioneers like
himself, and the daughters of mothers who had contributed
share and share alike to those foundations which had made
his success possible. Although a few developed latent qualities
of parasitism, the majority were strangely discontented
(strangely, that is, from his point of view) with the job of
mere Victorian ornament. What more natural under the circumstances
than that the unimportant things of life—art,
music, religion, literature, the intellectual life—should be
handed over to them to keep them busy and contented, while
he confined himself to the real man’s job of making money
and getting on in the world? Was it not a happy and sensible
adaptation of function?</p>

<p>Happy or not, it was exactly what took place. To an extent
almost incomprehensible to the peoples of older cultures, the
things of the mind and the spirit have been given over, in
America, into the almost exclusive custody of women. This
has been true certainly of art, certainly of music, certainly of
education. The spinster school-marm has settled in the
impressionable, adolescent minds of boys the conviction that
the cultural interests are largely an affair of the other sex;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
the intellectual life can have no connection with native gaiety,
with sexual curiosity, with play, with creative dreaming, or
with adventure. These more genuine impulses, he is made to
feel, are not merely distinguishable from the intellectual life,
but actually at war with it. In my own day at Harvard the
Westerners in my class looked with considerable suspicion
upon those who specialized in literature, the classics, or philosophy—a
man’s education should be science, economics, engineering.
Only “sissies,” I was informed, took courses in
poetry out in that virile West. And to this day for a boy to
be taught to play the piano, for example, is regarded as
“queer,” whereas for a girl to be so taught is entirely in the
nature of things. That is, natural aptitude has nothing to
do with it; some interests are proper for women, others for
men. Of course there are exceptions enough to make even
the boldest hesitate at generalizations, yet assuredly the contempt,
as measured in the only terms we thoroughly understand,
money, with which male teachers, male professors (secretly),
male ministers, and male artists are universally held
should convince the most prejudiced that, speaking broadly,
this generalization is in substance correct.</p>

<p>In fact, when we try to survey the currents of our entire
national life, to assess these vagrant winds of doctrine free
from the ingenuousness that our own academic experience or
training may give us, the more shall we perceive that the
dichotomy between the cultural and intellectual life of men
and women in this country has been carried farther than anywhere
else in the world. We need only recall the older
women’s clubs of the comic papers—in truth, the actual
women’s clubs of to-day as revealed by small-town newspaper
reports of their meetings—the now deliquescent Browning
Clubs, the Chautauquas, the church festivals, the rural normal
schools for teachers, the women’s magazines, the countless
national organizations for improving, elevating, uplifting this,
that, or the other. One shudders slightly and turns to the
impeccable style, the slightly tired and sensuous irony of
Anatole France (not yet censored, if we read him in French)
for relief. Or if we are so fortunate as to be “regular”
Americans instead of unhappy intellectuals educated beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
our environment, we go gratefully back to our work at the
office. Beside the stilted artificiality of this world of higher
ethical values the business world, where men haggle, cheat, and
steal with whole-hearted devotion is at least real. And it is
this world, the world of making money, in which alone the
American man can feel thoroughly at home. If the French
romanticists of the 18th century invented the phrase <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la femme
mécomprise</i>, a modern Gallic visitor would be tempted to observe
that in this 20th century the United States was the
land of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">l’homme mécompris</i>.</p>

<p>These, then, are the cruder historical forces that have led
directly to the present remarkable situation, a situation, of
course, which I attempt to depict only in its larger outlines.
For the surface of the contemporary social structure shows us
suffrage, the new insights into the world of industry which the
war gave so many women for the first time, the widening of
professional opportunity, co-education, and, in the life which
perhaps those of us who have contributed to this volume know
best, a genuine intellectual camaraderie. Nevertheless, I believe
the underlying thesis cannot be successfully challenged.
Where men and women in America to-day share their intellectual
life on terms of equality and perfect understanding,
closer examination reveals that the phenomenon is not
a sharing but a capitulation. The men have been feminized.</p>

<p>Thus far through this essay I have by implication rather
than direct statement contrasted genuine interest in intellectual
things with the kind of intellectual life led by women. Let me
say now that no intention is less mine than to contribute to
the old controversy concerning the respective intellectual capacities
of the two sexes. If I use the adjective “masculine”
to denote a more valid type of intellectual impulse than is expressed
by the adjective “feminine,” it is not to belittle the
quality of the second impulse; it is a matter of definition.
Further, the relative degree of “masculine” and “feminine”
traits possessed by an individual are almost as much the result
of acquired training as of native inheritance. The young, independent
college girl of to-day is in fact more likely to possess
“masculine” intellectual habits than is the average<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
Y.M.C.A. director. I use the adjectives to express broad,
general characteristics as they are commonly understood.</p>

<p>For a direct examination of the intellectual life of women—which,
I repeat, is practically the intellectual life of the
nation—in the United States shows the necessity of terms being
defined more sharply. Interest in intellectual things is
first, last, and all the time <em>disinterested</em>; it is the love of truth,
if not exclusively for its own sake, at least without fear of
consequences, in fact with precious little thought about consequences.
This does not mean that such exercise of the
native disposition to think, such slaking of the natural metaphysical
curiosity in all of us, is not a process enwrapped—as
truly as the disposition to make love or to get angry—with
an emotional aura of its own, a passion as distinctive as any
other. It merely means that the occasions which stimulate this
innate intellectual disposition are of a different sort than those
which stimulate our other dispositions. An imaginative picture
of one’s enlarged social self will arouse our instincts of
ambition or a desire to found a family, whereas curiosity or
wonder about the mystery of life, the meaning of death, the
ultimate nature of God (objects of desire as truly as other
objects) will arouse our intellectual disposition. These occasions,
objects, hypotheses are of necessity without moral significance.
The values inherent in them are the values of satisfied
contemplation and not of practical result. Their immediate
utility—although their ultimate, by the paradox that is
constantly making mere common sense inadequate, may be
very great—is only subjective. In this sense, they seem wayward
and masculine; and, cardinal sin of all, useless.</p>

<p>Perhaps the meaning of the “feminine” approach to the
intellectual life may be made somewhat clearer by this preliminary
definition. The basic assumption of such an approach
is that ideas are measured for their value by terms
outside the ideas themselves, or, as Mrs. Mary Austin recently
said in a magazine article, by “her [woman’s] deep
sense of social applicability as the test of value.” Fundamentally,
in a word, the intellectual life is an instrument of moral
reform; the real test of ideas lies in their utilitarian success.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
Hence it is hardly surprising that the intellectual life, as I
have defined it, of women in America turns out on examination
not to be an intellectual life at all, but sociological activity.
The best of modern women thinkers in the United States—and
there are many—are oftenest technical experts, keen to
apply knowledge and skill to the formulation of a technique
for the better solution of problems <em>the answers to which are
already assumed</em>. The question of fundamental ends is seldom
if ever raised: for example, the desirability of the modern
family, the desirability of children glowing with health, the
desirability of monogamy are not challenged. They are assumed
as ends desirable in themselves, and what women usually
understand by the intellectual life is the application of
modern scientific methods to a sort of enlarged and subtler
course in domestic science.</p>

<p>This attitude of contempt for mere intellectual values has
of course been strengthened by the native pioneer suspicion
of all thought that does not issue immediately in successful
action. The remarkable growth of pragmatism, and its sturdy
offspring instrumentalism, where ideas become but the lowly
handmaidens of “getting on,” has been possible to the extent
to which we see it to-day precisely because the intellectual
atmosphere has been surcharged with this feminized utilitarianism.
We are deeply uncomfortable before introspection,
contemplation, or scrupulous adherence to logical sequence.
Women do not hesitate to call these activities cold, impersonal,
indirect—I believe they have a phrase for them, “the poobah
tradition of learning.” With us the concept of the intellect
as a soulless machine operating in a rather clammy void has
acquired the force of folklore because we have so much wished
to strip it of warmth and colour. We have wanted to discredit
it in itself; we have respected it only for what it could
do. If its operations lead to better sanitation, better milk
for babies, and larger bridges over which, in Matthew Arnold’s
phrase, we might cross more rapidly from one dismal, illiberal
city to another dismal, illiberal city, then those operations have
been justified. That the life of the mind might have an emotional
drive, a sting or vibrancy of its own, constituting as
valuable a contribution to human happiness as, say, the satisfied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
marital felicity of the bacteria-less suburbanite in his
concrete villa has been incomprehensible. Every science must
be an <em>applied</em> science, the intellect must be <em>applied</em> intellect
before we thoroughly understand it. We have created an
environment in which the intellectual impulses must become
fundamentally social in quality and mood, whereas the truth
of the matter is that these impulses, like the religious impulse,
in their pristine spontaneity are basically individualistic and
capricious rather than disciplined.</p>

<p>But such individualism in thought, unless mellowed by contact
with institutions that assume and cherish it and thus can,
without patronizing, correct its wildnesses, inevitably turns
into eccentricity. And such, unfortunately, has too often been
the history of American intellectuals. The institutional structure
that might sustain them and keep them on the main
track of the humanistic tradition has been too fragile and
too slight. The university and college life, the educational
institutions, even the discipline of scholarship, as other essays
in this volume show us, have been of very little assistance.
Even the church has provoked recalcitrance rather than any
real reorientation of religious viewpoint, and our atheists—recall
Ingersoll—have ordinarily been quite conventional in
their intellectual outlook. With educated Englishmen, for example,
whatever their religious, economic, or political views,
there has been a certain common tradition or point of departure
and understanding, i.e., the classics. Mr. Balfour can
speak the same language as Mr. Bertrand Russell, even when
he is a member of a government that puts Mr. Russell in gaol
for his political opposition to the late war. But it really is a
strain on the imagination to picture Mr. Denby quoting Hume
to refute Mr. Weeks, or Vice-President Coolidge engaging in
an epistemological controversy with Postmaster-General Hays.
There is no intellectual background common to President
Harding and Convict Debs or to any one person and possibly
as many as a hundred others—there are only common social
or geographical backgrounds, in which the absence of a real
community of interests is pathetically emphasized by grotesque
emphasis upon fraternal solidarity, as when Mr. Harding discovered
that he and his chauffeur belonged to the same lodge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
regarding this purely fortuitous fact as a symbol of the healing
power of the Fathers and of American Democracy!</p>

<p>In such an atmosphere of shadowy spiritual relationships,
where the thinness of contact of mind with mind is childishly
disguised under the banner of good fellowship, it might be
expected that the intellectual life must be led not only with
that degree of individualistic isolation which is naturally necessary
for its existence, but likewise in a hostile and unintelligent
environment of almost enforced “difference” from the
general social type. Such an atmosphere will become as infested
with cranks, fanatics, mushroom religious enthusiasts,
moral prigs with new schemes of perfectability, inventors of
perpetual motion, illiterate novelists, and oratorical cretins, as
a swamp with mosquitoes. They seem to breed almost overnight;
we have no standard to which the wise and the foolish
may equally repair, no criterion by which spontaneously to
appraise them and thus, by robbing them of the breath of
their life, recognition, reduce their numbers. On the contrary,
we welcome them all with a kind of Jamesian gusto, as if
every fool, like every citizen, must have his right to vote. It
is a kind of intellectual enfranchisement that produces the
same sort of leadership which, in the political field of complete
suffrage, we suffer under from Washington and our various
State capitals. Our intellectual life, when we judge it
objectively on the side of vigour and diversity, too often seems
like a democracy of mountebanks.</p>

<p>Yet when we turn from the more naïve and popular experiments
for finding expression for the baulked disposition to
think, the more sophisticated <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">jeunesse dorée</i> of our cultural
life are equally crippled and sterile. They suffer not so much
from being thought and being “queer”—in fact, inwardly
deeply uncomfortable at not being successful business men,
they are scrupulously conventional in manner and appearance—but
from what Professor Santayana has called, with his
usual felicity, “the genteel tradition.” It is a blight that
falls on the just and the unjust; like George Bernard Shaw,
they are tolerant before the caprices of the mind, and intolerant
before the caprices of the body. They acquire their
disability from the essentially American (and essentially feminine)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
timorousness before life itself; they seem to want to
confine, as do all good husbands and providers, adventure to
mental adventure and tragedy to an error in ratiocination.
They will discant generously about liberty of opinion—although,
strictly speaking, <em>opinion</em> is always free; all that is
restricted is the right to put it into words—yet seem singularly
silent concerning liberty of action. If this were a mere
temperamental defect, it would of course have no importance.
But it cuts much deeper. Thought, like mist, arises from
the earth, and to it must eventually return, if it is not to be
dissipated into the ether. The genteel tradition, which has
stolen from the intellectual life its own proper possessions,
gaiety and laughter, has left it sour and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déraciné</i>. It has lost
its earthy roots, its sensuous fulness, its bodily <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mise-en-scène</i>.
One has the feeling, when one talks to our correct intellectuals,
that they are somehow brittle and might be cracked with a pun,
a low story, or an animal grotesquerie as an eggshell might be
cracked. Yet whatever else thought may be in itself, surely
we know that it has a biological history and an animal setting;
it can reach its own proper dignity and effectiveness
only when it functions in some kind of rational relationship
with the more clamorous instincts of the body. The adjustment
must be one of harmony and welcome; real thinkers do
not make this ascetic divorce between the passions and the
intellect, the emotions and the reason, which is the central
characteristic of the genteel tradition. Thought is nourished
by the soil it feeds on, and in America to-day that soil is
choked with the feckless weeds of correctness. Our sanitary
perfection, our material organization of goods, our muffling of
emotion, our deprecation of curiosity, our fear of idle adventure,
our horror of disease and death, our denial of suffering—what
kind of soil of life is that?</p>

<p>Surely not an over-gracious or thrilling one; small wonder
that our intellectual plants wither in this carefully aseptic
sunlight.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, though I was tempted to give the sub-title “A
Study in Sterility” to this essay, I do not believe that our
soil is wholly sterile. Beneath the surface barrenness stirs
a germinal energy that may yet push its way through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
weeds and the tin-cans of those who are afraid of life. If
the genteel tradition did not succumb to the broad challenge
of Whitman, his invitations have not been wholly rejected by
the second generation following him. The most hopeful thing
of intellectual promise in America to-day is the contempt of
the younger people for their elders; they are restless, uneasy,
disaffected. It is not a disciplined contempt; it is not yet
kindled by any real love of intellectual values—how could it
be? Yet it is a genuine and moving attempt to create a way
of life free from the bondage of an authority that has lost all
meaning, even to those who wield it. Some it drives in futile
and pathetic expatriotism from the country; others it makes
headstrong and reckless; many it forces underground, where,
much as in Russia before the revolution of 1905, the <em>intelligentsia</em>
meet their own kind and share the difficulties of their
common struggle against an environment that is out to destroy
them. But whatever its crudeness and headiness, it is a yeast
composed always of those who <em>will not</em> conform. The more
the pressure of standardization is applied to them the sharper
and keener—if often the wilder—becomes their rebellion
against it. Just now these non-conformists constitute a spiritual
fellowship which is disorganized and with few points of
contact. It may be ground out of existence, for history is
merciless and every humanistic interlude resembles a perilous
equipoise of barbaric forces. Only arrogance and self-complacency
give warrant for assuming that we may not be
facing a new kind of dark age. On the other hand, if the
more amiable and civilized of the generation now growing up
can somehow consolidate their scattered powers, what may
they not accomplish? For we have a vitality and nervous
alertness which, properly channelled and directed, might cut
through the rocks of stupidity with the precision and spaciousness
with which our mechanical inventions have seized on our
natural resources and turned them into material goods. Our
cup of life is full to the brim.</p>

<p>I like to think that this cup will not all be poured upon
the sandy deltas of industrialism ... we have so much to
spare! Climb to the top of the Palisades and watch the great
city in the deepening dusk as light after light, and rows of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
lights after rows, topped by towers of radiance at the end
of the island, shine through the shadows across the river.
Think, then, of the miles of rolling plains, fertile and dotted
with cities, stretching behind one to that other ocean which
washes a civilization that was old before we were born and
yet to-day gratefully accepts our pitiful doles to keep it from
starvation, of the millions of human aspirations and hopes
and youthful eagernesses contained in the great sprawling, uneasy
entity we call our country—must all the hidden beauty
and magic and laughter we know is ours be quenched because
we lack the courage to make it proud and defiant? Or walk
down the Avenue some late October morning when the sun
sparkles in a clear and electric air such as can be found nowhere
else in the world. The flashing beauty of form, the
rising step of confident animalism, the quick smile of fertile
minds—must all these things, too, be reduced to a drab uniformity
because we lack the courage to proclaim their sheer
physical loveliness? Has not the magic of America been hidden
under a fog of ugliness by those who never really loved
it, who never knew our natural gaiety and high spirits and
eagerness for knowledge? They have the upper hand now—but
who would dare to prophesy that they can keep it?</p>

<p>Perhaps this is only a day-dream, but surely one can hope
that the America of our natural affections rather than the present
one of enforced dull standardization may some day snap
the shackles of those who to-day keep it a spiritual prison.
And as surely will it be the rebellious and disaffected who accomplish
the miracle, if it is ever accomplished. Because at
bottom their revolt, unlike the aggressions of the standardizers,
is founded not on hate of what they cannot understand, but
on love of what they wish all to share.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SCIENCE">SCIENCE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> scientific work of our countrymen has probably
evoked less scepticism on the part of foreign judges than
their achievements in other departments of cultural activity.
There is one obvious reason for this difference. When our
letters, our art, our music are criticized with disdainfully faint
commendation, it is because they have failed to attain the
higher reaches of creative effort. Supreme accomplishment in
art certainly presupposes a graduated series of lesser strivings,
yet from what might be called the consumer’s angle, mediocrity
is worthless and incapable of giving inspiration to genius. But
in science it is otherwise. Here every bit of sound work—however
commonplace—counts as a contribution to the stock
of knowledge; and, what is more, on labours of this lesser order
the superior mind is frequently dependent for its own
syntheses. A combination of intelligence, technical efficiency,
and application may not by itself suffice to read the riddles
of the universe; but, to change the metaphor, it may well provide
the foundation for the epoch-makers’ structure. So while
it is derogatory to American literature to be considered a mere
reflection of English letters, it is no reflection on American
scientists that they have gone to Europe to acquire that craftsmanship
which is an indispensable prerequisite to fruitful
research. And when we find Alexander von Humboldt praising
in conversation with Silliman the geographical results of Maury
and Frémont, there is no reason to suspect him of perfunctory
politeness to a transatlantic visitor; the veteran scholar might
well rejoice in the ever widening application of methods he
had himself aided in perfecting.</p>

<p>Thus even seventy years ago and more the United States had
by honest, painstaking labour made worthwhile additions to
human knowledge and these contributions have naturally multiplied
a hundredfold with the lapse of years. Yet it would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
quite misleading to make it appear as if the total represented
merely a vast accumulation of uninspired routine jobs. Some
years ago, to be sure, an American writer rather sensationally
voiced his discontent with the paucity of celebrated <em>savants</em>
among our countrymen. But he forgot that in science fame
is a very inadequate index of merit. The precise contribution
made by one man’s individual ability is one of the most tantalizingly
difficult things to determine—so much so that scholars
are still debating in what measure Galileo’s predecessors
paved the way for his discoveries in dynamics. For a layman,
then, to appraise the relative significance of this or that intellectual
worthy on the basis of current gossip is rather absurd.
Certainly the lack of a popular reputation is a poor reason
for denying greatness to a contemporary or even near-contemporary
scientific thinker. Two remarkable instances at once
come to mind of Americans who have won the highest distinction
abroad yet remain unknown by name to many of their
most cultivated compatriots. Who has ever heard of Willard
Gibbs? Yet he was the recipient of the Copley medal, British
learning’s highest honour, and his phase rule is said to mark an
epoch in the progress of physical chemistry. Again, prior to
the Nobel prize award, who outside academic bowers had ever
heard of the crucial experiment by which a Chicago physicist
showed, to quote Poincaré, “that the physical procedures are
powerless to put in evidence absolute motion”? Michelson’s
name is linked with all the recent speculations on relativity,
and he shares with Einstein the fate of finding himself famous
one fine morning through the force of purely external circumstances.</p>

<p>In even the briefest and most random enumeration of towering
native sons it is impossible to ignore the name of William
James. Here for once the suffrage of town and gown, of domestic
and alien judges, is unanimous. Naturally James can
never mean quite the same to the European world that he
means to us, because in the United States he is far more than a
great psychologist, philosopher, or literary man. Owing to our
peculiar spiritual history, he occupies in our milieu an altogether
unique position. His is the solitary example of an
American pre-eminent in a branch of science who at the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
time succeeded in deeply affecting the cultural life of a whole
generation. Further, he is probably the only one of our genuinely
original men to be thoroughly saturated with the essense
of old world civilization. On the other side of the Atlantic,
of course, neither of these characteristics would confer
a patent of distinction. Foreign judgment of James’s psychological
achievement was consequently not coloured by external
considerations, and it is all the more remarkable that
the “Principles of Psychology” was so widely and by
such competent critics acclaimed as a synthesis of the first
order.</p>

<p>Without attempting to exhaust the roster of great names, I
must mention Simon Newcomb and his fellow-astronomer,
George W. Hill, both Copley medallists. Newcomb, in particular,
stood out as the foremost representative of his science
in this country, honoured here and abroad alike for his abstruse
original researches into the motion of the moon and
the planetary system and for his effective popularization.
Henry Augustus Rowland, the physicist, was another of our
outstanding men—one, incidentally, whose measure was taken
in Europe long before his greatness dawned upon his colleagues
at home. He is celebrated, among other things, for
perfecting an instrument of precision and for a new and more
accurate determination of the mechanical equivalent of heat.
Among geologists Grove Karl Gilbert, famous for his exploration
of Lake Bonneville—the major forerunner of Great Salt
Lake—and his investigations of mountain structure, stands
forth as one of our pre-eminent savants. Even those who, like
the present writer, enjoyed merely casual contact with that
grand old man could not fail to gain the impression that now
they knew what a great scientist looked like in the flesh and to
feel that such a one would be a fit member of any intellectual
galaxy anywhere.</p>

<p>If from single individuals we turn to consider currents of
scientific thought, the United States again stands the trial with
flying colours. It can hardly be denied that in a number
of branches our countrymen are marching in the vanguard.
“Experimental biology,” said a German zoologist some time
before the War, “is pre-eminently an American science.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
Certainly one need merely glance at German or British manuals
to learn how deeply interpretations of basic evolutionary
phenomena have been affected by the work of Professor T.
H. Morgan and his followers. In psychology it is true that no
one wears the mantle of William James, but there is effective
advancement along a number of distinct lines. Thorndike’s
tests marked an era in the annals of animal psychology, supplanting
with a saner technique the slovenly work of earlier
investigators. Experimental investigation of mental phenomena
generally, of individual variability and behaviour in particular,
flourishes in a number of academic centres. In anthropology
the writings of Lewis H. Morgan have proved a
tremendous stimulus to sociological speculation the world over
and still retain their hold on many European thinkers. They
were not, in my opinion, the product of a great intellect and
the scheme of evolution traced by Morgan is doomed to abandonment.
Yet his theories have suggested a vast amount of
thought and to his lasting credit it must be said that he opened
up an entirely new and fruitful field of recondite research
through his painstaking accumulation and discussion of primitive
kinship terminologies.</p>

<p>More recently the anthropological school headed by Professor
Boas has led to a transvaluation of theoretical values in
the study of cultural development, supplanting with a sounder
historical insight the cruder evolutionary speculation of the
past. Above all, its founder has succeeded in perfecting the
methodology of every division of the vast subject, and remains
probably the only anthropologist in the world who has both
directly and indirectly furthered ethnological, linguistic, somatological
and archæological investigation. Finally, the active
part played by pathologists like Dr. Simon Flexner in the experimental
study of disease is too well known to require more
than brief mention.</p>

<p>Either in its individual or collective results, American research
is thus very far from being a negligible factor in the
scientific life of the world. Nevertheless, the medal has a reverse
side, and he would be a bold optimist who should sincerely
voice complete contentment either with the status of
science in the cultural polity of the nation or with the work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
achieved by the average American investigator. Let us, then,
try to face the less flattering facts in the case.</p>

<p>The fundamental difficulty can be briefly summarized by
applying the sociologist’s concept of maladjustment. American
science, notwithstanding its notable achievements, is not an organic
product of our soil; it is an epiphenomenon, a hothouse
growth. It is still the prerogative of a caste, not a treasure in
which the nation glories. We have at best only a nascent class
of cultivated laymen who relish scientific books requiring concentrated
thought or supplying large bodies of fact. This is
shown most clearly by the rarity of articles of this type even
in our serious magazines. Our physicians, lawyers, clergymen
and journalists—in short, our educated classes—do not
encourage the publication of reading-matter which is issued in
Europe as a profitable business venture. It is hard to conceive
of a book like Mach’s “Analyse der Empfindungen”
running through eight editions in the United States. Conversely,
it is not strange that hardly any of our first-rate men
find it an alluring task to seek an understanding with a larger
audience. Newcomb and James are of course remarkable exceptions,
but they <em>are</em> exceptions. Here again the contrast
with European conditions is glaring. Not to mention the
classic popularizers of the past, England, e.g., can boast even
to-day of such men as Pearson, Soddy, Joly, Hinks—all of
them competent or even distinguished in their professional
work yet at the same time skilful interpreters of their field to
a wider public. But for a healthy cultural life a rapport of
this sort between creator and appreciator is an indispensable
prerequisite, and it is not a whit less important in science than
in music or poetry.</p>

<p>The estrangement of science from its social environment has
produced anomalies almost inconceivable in the riper civilizations
of the Old World. Either the scientist loses contact with
his surroundings or in the struggle for survival he adapts himself
by a surrender of his individuality, that is, by more or less
disingenuously parading as a lowbrow and representing himself
as a dispenser of worldly goods. It is quite true that, historically,
empirical knowledge linked with practical needs is
earlier than rational science; it is also true that applied and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
pure science can be and have been mutual benefactors. This
lesson is an important one and in a country with a scholastic
tradition like Germany it was one that men like Mach and Ostwald
did well to emphasize. But in an age and country where
philosophers pique themselves on ignoring philosophical problems
and psychologists have become experts in advertising technique,
the emphasis ought surely to be in quite the opposite
direction, and that, even if one inclines in general to a utilitarian
point of view. For nothing is more certain than that a
penny-wise Gradgrind policy is a pound-foolish one. A friend
teaching in one of our engineering colleges tells me that owing
to the “practical” training received there the graduates are
indeed able to apply formulæ by rote but flounder helplessly
when confronted by a new situation, which drives them to seek
counsel with the despised and underpaid “theoretical” professor.
The plea for pure science offered by Rowland in 1883
is not yet altogether antiquated in 1921: “To have the applications
of a science, the science itself must exist ... we have
taken the science of the Old World, and applied it to all our
uses, accepting it like the rain of heaven, without asking whence
it came, or even acknowledging the debt of gratitude we owe
to the great and unselfish workers who have given it to us....
To a civilized nation of the present day, the applications of
science are a necessity, and our country has hitherto succeeded
in this line, only for the reason that there are certain countries
in the world where pure science has been and is cultivated, and
where the study of nature is considered a noble pursuit.”</p>

<p>The Bœotian disdain for research as a desirable pursuit is
naturally reflected in the mediocre encouragement doled out
to investigators, who are obliged to do their work by hook or
by crook and to raise funds by the undignified cajolery of
wealthy patrons and a disingenuous <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">argumentum ad hominem</i>.
Heaven forbid that money be appropriated to attack a problem
which, in the opinion of the best experts, calls for solution;
effort must rather be diverted to please an ignorant benefactor
bent on establishing a pet theory or fired with the zeal to
astound the world by a sensational discovery.</p>

<p>Another aspect of scientific life in the United States that
reflects the general cultural conditions is the stress placed on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
organization and administration as opposed to individual effort.
It is quite true that for the prosecution of elaborate investigations
careful allotment of individual tasks contributory
to the general end is important and sometimes even indispensable.
But some of the greatest work in the history of science
has been achieved without regard for the principles of business
efficiency; and whatever advantage may accrue in the future
from administrative devices is negligible in comparison with
the creative thought of scientific men. These, and only these,
can lend value to the machinery of organization, which independently
of them must remain a soulless instrument. The
overweighting of efficiency schemes as compared to creative
personalities is only a symptom of a general maladjustment.
Intimately related with this feature is that cynical flouting of
intellectual values that appears in the customary attitude of
trustees and university presidents towards those who shed
lustre on our academic life. The professional pre-eminence
of a scientist may be admitted by the administrative officials
but it is regarded as irrelevant since the standard of values accepted
by them is only remotely, if at all, connected with originality
or learning.</p>

<p>There are, of course, scientists to whom deference is paid
even by trustees, nay, by the wives of trustees; but it will be
usually found that they are men of independent means or social
prestige. It is, in other words, their wealth and position, not
their creative work, that raises them above their fellows. One
of the most lamentable results of this contempt for higher
values is the failure to provide for ample leisure that might be
devoted to research. The majority of our scientists, like those
abroad, gain a livelihood by teaching, but few foreign observers
fail to be shocked by the way the energies of their
American colleagues are frittered away on administrative
routine and elementary instruction till neither time nor strength
remains for the advancement of knowledge. But even this does
not tell the whole story, for we must remember that the
younger scientists are as a rule miserably underpaid and are
obliged to eke out a living by popular writing or lecturing, so
that research becomes a sheer impossibility. If Ostwald and
Cattell are right in associating the highest productivity with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
the earlier years of maturity, the tragic effects of such conditions
as I have just described are manifest.</p>

<p>In justice, however, mention must be made of a number of
institutions permitting scientific work without imposing any
obligation to teach or onerous administrative duties. The U.
S. Geological Survey, the Carnegie Institution, the Rockefeller
Institute may serve as examples. We must likewise remember
that different individuals react quite differently to the necessity
for teaching. Some of the most noted investigators—Rowland,
for instance—find a moderate amount of lecturing positively
stimulating. In a utopian republic of learning such individual
variations would be carefully considered in the allotment
of tasks. The association of the Lick Observatory with
the University of California seems to approximate to ideal conditions,
inasmuch as its highly trained astronomers are relieved
of all academic duties but enjoy the privilege of lecturing to
the students when the spirit moves them.</p>

<p>To return to the main question, the maladjustment between
the specific scientific phase of our civilization and the general
cultural life produces certain effects even more serious than
those due to penury, administrative tyranny, and popular indifference,
for they are less potent and do not so readily evoke
defence-mechanisms on the victims’ part. There is, first of
all, a curtailment of potential scientific achievement through
the general deficiencies of the cultural environment.</p>

<p>Much has been said by both propagandists and detractors
of German scholarship about the effects of intensive specialization.
But an important feature commonly ignored in this connection
is that in the country of its origin specialization is a
concomitant and successor of a liberal education. Whatever
strictures may be levelled at the traditional form of this preparatory
training—and I have seen it criticized as severely by
German writers as by any—the fact remains that the German
university student has a broad cultural background such as his
American counterpart too frequently lacks; and what is true
of Germany holds with minor qualifications for other European
countries.</p>

<p>A trivial example will serve to illustrate the possible advantages
of a cultural foundation for very specialized research.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
Music is notoriously one of the salient features of German
culture, not merely because Germany has produced great composers
but because of the wide appreciation and quite general
study of music. Artistically the knowledge of the piano or
violin acquired by the average child in the typical German
home may count for naught, yet in at least two branches of
inquiry it may assume importance. The psychological aspect
of acoustics is likely to attract and to be fruitfully cultivated
by those conversant with musical technique, and they alone
will be capable of grappling with the comparative problems
presented by the study of primitive music—problems that
would never occur to the average Anglo-Saxon field ethnologist,
yet to which the German would apply his knowledge as spontaneously
as he applies the multiplication table to a practical
matter of everyday purchase.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, all the phenomena of the universe are
interrelated and, accordingly, the most important advances may
be expected from a revelation of the less patent connections.
For this purpose a diversity of interests with corresponding
variety of information may be not only a favourable condition
but a prerequisite. Helmholtz may have made an indifferent
physician; but because he combined a medical practitioner’s
knowledge with that of a physicist he was enabled to devise the
ophthalmoscope. So it may be that not one out of ten thousand
men who might apply themselves to higher mathematics
would ever be able to advance mathematical theory, but it is
certainly true that the manipulatory skill acquired would stand
them in good stead not only in the exact sciences but in biology,
psychology, and anthropometry, in all of which the theory of
probability can be effectively applied to the phenomenon of
variability.</p>

<p>I do not mean to assert that the average European student
is an Admirable Crichton utilizing with multidexterity the most
diverse methods of research and groups of fact. But I am
convinced that many European workers produce more valuable
work than equally able Americans for the sole reason that
the European’s social heritage provides him with agencies
ready-made for detecting correlations that must inevitably
elude a vision narrower because deprived of the same artificial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
aid. The remedy lies in enriching the cultural atmosphere and
in insisting on a broad educational training over and above
that devoted to the specialist’s craftsmanship.</p>

<p>Important, however, as variety of information and interests
doubtless are, one factor must take precedence in the scientist’s
equipment—the spirit in which he approaches his scientific
work as a whole. In this respect the point that would probably
strike most European or, at all events, Continental scientists
is the rarity in America of philosophical inquiries into
the foundations of one’s scientific position. The contrast with
German culture is of course sharp, and in many Teutonic
works the national bent for epistemological discussion is undoubtedly
carried to a point where it ceases to be palatable to
those not to the manner born. Yet this tendency has a salutary
effect in stimulating that contempt for mere authority
which is indispensable for scientific progress. What our average
American student should acquire above all is a stout faith
in the virtues of <em>reasoned nonconformism</em>, and in this phrase
adjective and noun are equally significant. On one hand, we
must condemn the blind deference with which too many of
our investigators accept the judgments of acknowledged greatness.
What can be more ridiculous, e.g., than to make dogmas
of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">obiter dicta</i> of a man like William James, the chief
lesson of whose life is a resentment of academic traditionalism?
Or, what shall we think of a celebrated biologist who decides
the problem of Lamarckianism by a careful weighing not of
arguments but of authorities? No one can approve of the
grim ferocity, reminiscent of the literary feuds of Alexander
Pope, with which German savants sometimes debate problems
of theoretic interest. Yet even such billingsgate as Dührring
levelled at Helmholtz is preferable to obsequious discipleship.
It testifies, at all events, to the glorious belief that in the
republic of learning fame and position count for naught, that
the most illustrious scientist shall not be free from the criticism
of the meanest <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Privatdozent</i>, But the nonconformism should
be rational. It is infantile to cling to leading-strings but it is
no less childish to thrust out one’s tongue at doctrines that
happen to disagree with those of one’s own clique. Indeed,
frequently both forms of puerility are combined: it is easy to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
sneer with James at Wundt or to assault the selectionists under
cover of De Vries’s mutationism. A mature thinker will forego
the short and easy but misleading road. Following Fechner,
he will be cautious in his belief but equally cautious in his disbelief.</p>

<p>It is only such spiritual freedom that makes the insistence
on academic freedom a matter worth fighting for. After all,
what is the use of a man’s teaching what he pleases, if he quite
sincerely retails the current folk-lore? In one of the most remarkable
chapters of the “Mechanik” Ernst Mach points out
that the detriment to natural philosophy due to the political
power of the Church is easily exaggerated. Science was retarded
primarily not because scientists were driven by outward
compulsion to spread such and such views but because they uncritically
swallowed the cud of folk-belief. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Voilà l’ennemi!</i>
In the insidious influence of group opinions, whether countenanced
by Church, State or a scientific hierarchy, lies the basic
peril. The philosophic habit of unremitting criticism of one’s
basic assumptions is naturally repugnant to a young and naïve
culture, and it cannot be expected to spring up spontaneously
and flower luxuriantly in science while other departments of
life fail to yield it nurture. Every phase of our civilization
must be saturated with that spirit of positive scepticism which
Goethe and Huxley taught before science can reap a full harvest
in her own field. But her votaries, looking back upon
the history of science, may well be emboldened to lead in the
battle, and if the pioneers in the movement should fail they
may well console themselves with Milton’s hero: “... and
that strife was not inglorious, though the event was dire!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PHILOSOPHY">PHILOSOPHY</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Philosophy</span> is at once a product of civilization and a
stimulus to its development. It is the solvent in which
the inarticulate and conflicting aspirations of a people become
clarified and from which they derive directing force. Since,
however, philosophers are likely to clothe their thoughts in
highly technical language, there is need of a class of middle-men-interpreters
through whom philosophy penetrates the
masses. By American tradition, the philosophers have been
professors; the interpreters, clergymen. Professors are likely
to be deflected by the ideas embodied in the institutions with
which they associate themselves. The American college, in its
foundations, was designated a protector of orthodoxy and still
echoes what Santayana has so aptly called the “genteel tradition,”
the tradition that the teacher must defend the faith.
Some of the most liberal New England colleges even now demand
attendance at daily chapel and Sunday church. Less
than a quarter of a century ago, one could still find, among
major non-sectarian institutions, the clergyman-president, himself
a teacher, crowning the curriculum with a senior requirement,
Christian Evidences, in support of the Faith.</p>

<p>The nineteenth century organized a vigorous war against this
genteel tradition. Not only were the attacks of rationalism
on dogma reinforced by the ever-mounting tide of scientific
discovery within our institutions of learning, but also the news
of these scientific discoveries began to stir the imagination of
the public, and to carry the conflict of science and theology
beyond the control of the church-college. The greatest leaven
was Darwin’s “Origin of Species,” of which two American
editions were announced as early as 1860, one year after its
publication in England. The dogma of science came publicly
to confront the dogma of theology. Howsoever conservative
the college, it had to yield to the new intellectual temper and
the capitulation was facilitated by the army of young professors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
whom cheapened transportation and the rumour of
great achievements led to the universities of Germany.</p>

<p>From the point of view of popular interest, the immediate
effects of these pilgrimages were not wholly advantageous to
philosophy. In losing something of their American provincialism,
these pilgrims also lost their hold on American interests.
The problems that they brought back were rooted in a
foreign soil and tradition. To students they appeared artificial
and barren displays of technical skill. Thus an academic
philosophy of professordom arose, the more lonely through the
loss of the ecclesiastical mediators of the earlier tradition.
But here and there American vitality showed through its foreign
clothes and gradually an assimilation took place, the more
easily, perhaps, since German idealism naturally sustains the
genteel tradition and thrives amid the modes of thought that
Emerson had developed independently and for which his literary
gifts had obtained a following.</p>

<p>Wherever New England has constituted the skeletal muscles
of philosophic culture, its temper has remained unchanged.
Calvinism was brought to America because it suited this temper,
and the history of idealism in America is the history of
its preservation by adaptation to a changing environment of
ideas. Its marks are a sense of the presence of the Divine in
experience and a no less strong sense of inevitable evil. Jonathan
Edwards writes, “When we behold the light and brightness
of the sun, the golden edges of an evening cloud, or the
beauteous bow, we behold the adumbrations of His glory and
goodness; and in the blue sky, of his mildness and gentleness.
There are also many things wherein we may behold His awful
majesty: in the sun in his strength, in comets, in thunder,
with the lowering thunder-clouds, in ragged rocks and the
brows of mountains.” Emerson’s version is: “Nature is always
consistent, though she feigns to contravene her own
laws.... She arms and equips an animal to find it place
and living in the earth, and at the same time she arms and
equips another animal to destroy it. Space exists to divide
creatures; but by clothing the sides of a bird with a few
feathers she gives him a petty omnipresence.... Nature is
the incarnation of a thought, and turns to a thought again, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
ice becomes water and gas. Every moment instructs and
every object; for wisdom is infused into every form.” And
Royce’s: “When they told us in childhood that we could not
see God just <em>because</em> he was everywhere, just because his
omnipresence gave us no chance to discern him and to fix our
eyes upon him, they told us a deep truth in allegorical fashion....
The Self is so little a thing merely guessed at as the
unknown source of experience, that already, in the very least
of daily experiences, you unconsciously know him as something
present.”</p>

<p>In its darker aspect this temper gives us Edwards’s “Sinners
in the Hands of an Angry God,” whose choices we may
not fathom. But Emerson is not far behind: “Great men,
great nations, have not been boasters and buffoons, but perceivers
of the terror of life, and have manned themselves to
face it.... At Lisbon, an earthquake killed men like flies.
At Naples, three years ago, ten thousand persons were crushed
in a few minutes. Etc.... Providence has a wild, rough,
incalculable road to its end, and it is of no use to try to whitewash
its huge, mixed instrumentalities, or to dress up that terrific
benefactor in the clean shirt and white neckcloth of a student
of divinity.” For Royce, “the worst tragedy of the
world is the tragedy of the brute chance to which everything
spiritual seems to be subject amongst us—the tragedy of the
diabolical irrationality of so many among the foes of whatever
is significant.”</p>

<p>Emersonian philosophy fails in two respects to satisfy the
demands of the puritanical temperament upon contemporary
thought. In building altars to the “Beautiful Necessity,”
it neglects to assimilate the discoveries of science, and it detaches
itself from the Christian tradition within which alone
this spirit feels at home. Both of these defects are met by the
greatest of American idealists, Professor Royce.</p>

<p>In character and thought Royce is the great reconciler of
contradictions. Irrational in his affections, and at his best
in the society of children, he stands for the absolute authority
of reason; filled with indignation at wrong and injustice, he
explains the presence of evil as an essential condition for the
good; keenly critical and not optimistic as to the concrete characters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
of men, he presents man as the image of God, a part of
the self-representative system through which the Divine nature
unfolds itself. Never was there a better illustration of
Pascal’s dictum that we use our reasons to support what we
already believe, not to attain conclusions. And never was
there greater self-deception as to the presence of this
process.</p>

<p>What man not already convinced of an Absolute could find
in error the proof of a deeper self that knows in unity all truth?
Who else could accept the dilemma “<em>either</em> ... your real
world yonder is through and through a world of ideas, an outer
mind that you are more or less comprehending through your
experience, <em>or else</em>, in so far as it is real and outer, it is unknowable,
an inscrutable X, an absolute mystery”? Without
the congeniality of belief, where is the thrill in assimilating
self-consciousness as infinite to a greater Infinite, as the infinite
systems of even numbers, or of odd numbers, or an infinity
of other infinite series can be assimilated to the greater
infinity of the whole number series as proper parts? Yet
Royce has been able to clothe these doctrines with vast erudition
and flashes of quaint humour, helped out by a prolix and
somewhat desultory memory, and give them life.</p>

<p>By virtue of the obscurantist logic inherent in this as in
other transcendental idealisms, there is a genuine attachment
to a certain aspect of Christianity. The identification of the
Absolute with the Logos of John in his “Spirit of Modern
Philosophy” and the frequent lapses into Scriptural language
are not mere tricks to inspire abstractions with the breath of
life. By such logic “selves” are never wholly distinct. If
we make classifications, they are all <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">secundum quid</i>. Absolute
ontological sundering is as mythical as the Snark. The
individual is essentially a member of a community of selves
that establishes duties for him under the demands of Loyalty.
This is the basis of Royce’s ethics. But the fellowship in
this community is also a participation in the “beloved community”
within which sin, atonement, and the dogma of
Pauline Christianity unfold themselves naturally in the guise
of social psychology. In such treatment of the “Problem
of Christianity” there is at most only a slight shifting of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
emphasis from the somewhat too self-conscious individualism
of his earliest philosophy.</p>

<p>Royce used to tell a story on himself that illustrates a reaction
of a part of the public to idealistic philosophy. At
the close of a lecture before a certain woman’s organization,
one of his auditors approached him with the words: “Oh, my
dear Professor Royce, I <em>did</em> enjoy your lectures <em>so</em> much! Of
course, I didn’t understand one word of it, but it was so evident
<em>you</em> understood it all, that it made it <em>very</em> enjoyable!”
The lady, though more frank in her confession, was probably
not intellectually inferior to a considerable portion of the idealist’s
public. James notes the fascination of hearing high things
talked about, even if one cannot understand. But time is,
alas, productive of comparative understanding, and it may be
with Royce, as with Emerson before him, that growth of understanding
contributes to narrowing the circle of his readers.
The imported mysteries of Eucken and Bergson offer newer
thrills, and a fuller sense of keeping up to date.</p>

<p>If Royce’s philosophy of religion has not the success that
might have been anticipated among those seeking a freer religion,
it is probably, as Professor Hocking suggests, because
“idealism does not do the work of religious truth.” Royce
has no interest in churches or sects. Christ is for him little
more than a shadow. Prayer and worship find no place in
his discussion. The mantle of the genteel tradition must then
fall on other shoulders, probably those of Hocking himself.
His “Meaning of God in Human Experience” is an effort to
unite realism, mysticism, and idealism to establish Christianity
as “organically rooted in passion, fact, and institutional life.”
Where idealism has destroyed the fear of Hell, this new interpretation
“restores the sense of infinite hazard, a wrath to
come, a heavenly city to be gained or lost in the process of time
and by the use of our freedom”!</p>

<p>In this philosophy, we ask, what has religion done for humanity
and how has it operated? Its effects appear in “the
basis of such certainties as we have, our self-respect, our belief
in human worth, our faith in the soul’s stability through all
catastrophes of physical nature, and in the integrity of history.”
But if we accept this “mass of actual deed, once and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
for all accomplished under the assurance of historic religion”
and through the medium of religious dogma and practice, does
this guarantee the future importance of religion? Much has
been accomplished under the conception that the earth was
flat, but the conception is nevertheless not valid.</p>

<p>It is too soon to estimate the depth of impression that this
philosophy will make on American culture. Professor Hocking
warns us against hastening to judge that the world is
becoming irreligious. He believes that the current distaste
for the language of orthodoxy may spring from the opposite
reason, that man is becoming potentially more religious. If
so, this fact may conspire with the American tradition of the
church-college to verify Professor Cohen’s assertion that “the
idealistic tradition still is and perhaps will long continue to be
the prevailing basis of philosophic instruction in America.”
But there are signs that point to an opposite conclusion and
the means of emancipation are at hand both in a change of
popular spirit and within philosophy itself.</p>

<p>The economic and social conditions that scattered the more
adventurous of the New Englanders through the developing
West, and the tides of immigration of the 19th century, have
weakened the hold of the Calvinistic spirit. These events, and
scientific education, are producing a generation that can look
upon the beauties of nature, be moved to enjoyment, admiration,
and wonder by them without, on that account, feeling
themselves in the presence of a supernatural Divine principle.
Success in mastering nature has overcome the feeling of helplessness
in the presence of misfortune. It breeds optimists of
intelligence. To a cataclysm such as the San Francisco earthquake,
it replies with organized relief and reconstruction in
reinforced concrete. If pestilence appears, it seeks the germ,
an antitoxin, and sanitary measures. There are no longer
altars built to the Beautiful Necessity.</p>

<p>Within philosophy, the most radical expression of this attitude
appears in the New Realism, and in the instrumentalism of
Dewey. In 1910, six of the younger American philosophers
issued in the <cite>Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific
Method</cite> “The Programme and First Platform of Six
Realists,” followed shortly by a co-operative volume of studies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
to elaborate the doctrine. Their deepest bond of union is a
distaste for the romantic spirit and obscurantist logic of Absolute
Idealism. Hence their dominant idea is to cut at the
very foundations of this system, the theory of relations in general,
and the relation of idea and object in particular. Young
America is not fond of the subtleties of history, hence these
realists take their stand upon the “unimpeachable truth of
the accredited results of science” at a time when, by the irony
of history, science herself has begun to doubt.</p>

<p>To thwart idealism, psychology must be rewritten. While
consciousness exists there is always the chance that our world
of facts may fade into subjective presentations. Seizing a
fruitful suggestion of James’, they introduce us to a world of
objects that exists quite independently of being known. The
relations of these objects are external to them and independent
of their character. Sometimes, however, there arise relations
between our organisms and other objects that can best be
described by asserting that these objects have entered into
our consciousness. How then can we fall into error? Only
as nature makes mistakes, by reacting in a way that brings
conflict with unnoted conditions. Perhaps the greatest contribution
of Realism as yet to American thought is the contribution
of some of its apostles to its implicit psychology,
already independently established as behaviourism, the most
vital movement in contemporary psychology.</p>

<p>The highly technical form of the Six Realists’ co-operative
volume has kept their doctrine from any great reading public.
But in its critical echoes, the busy American finds a sympathetic
note in the assertion of the independent reality of the
objects with which he works and the world in which he has
to make his way. His also is practical faith in science, and
he is glad to escape an inevitable type of religion and moral
theory to be swallowed along with philosophy. Until the New
Realists, however, develop further implications of their theory,
or at least present congenial religious, moral, and social attitudes,
their philosophy has only the negative significance of
release. If it is going to take a deep hold on life, it must
also be creative, not replacing dogma by dogma, but elaborating
some new world vision. As yet it has told us little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
more than that truth, goodness, and beauty are independent
realities, eternal subsistencies that await our discovery.</p>

<p>Professor Perry has outlined a realistic morality. For him
a right action is any that conduces to goodness and whatever
fulfils an interest is good. But a good action is not necessarily
moral. Morality requires the fulfilment of the greatest possible
number of interests, under the given circumstances; the
highest good, if attainable, would be an action fulfilling all possible
interests. This doctrine, though intelligible, is hard to
apply in specific instances. In it realism dissolves into pragmatism,
and its significance can best be seen in connection with
that philosophy, where it has received fuller development and
concrete applications.</p>

<p>Pragmatism obtained its initial impulse through a mind in
temper between the sturdy common sense of the New Realists
and the emotionalistic romanticism of the Idealists, or rather
comprehending both within itself. This mind is that of William
James, the last heir of the line of pure New England culture,
made cosmopolitan by travel and intellectual contacts.
Of Swedenborgian family, skilled alike in science and art,
James lived the mystical thrills of the unknown but could handle
them with the shrewdness of a Yankee trader. With
young America, his gaze is directed toward the future, and
with it, he is impatient of dogma and restraint. He is free
from conventions of thought and action with the freedom of
those who have lived them all in their ancestry and dare to face
realities without fear of social or intellectual <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">faux pas</i>. With
such new-found freedom goes a vast craving for experience.
For him, the deepest realities are the personal experiences of
individual men.</p>

<p>James’ greatest contribution is his “Psychology.” In it he
places himself in the stream of human experience, ruthlessly
cutting the gordian knots of psychological dogma and conventions.
The mind that he reports is the mind each of us sees
in himself. It is not so much a science of psychology as the
materials for such a science, a science in its descriptive stage,
constantly interrupted by shrewd homilies wherein habit appears
as the fly-wheel of society, or our many selves enlarge
the scope of sympathetic living. Nor is it congenial to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
adventurer in experience that his explorations should constrain
human nature within a scientist’s map. Not only must the
stream of consciousness flow between the boundaries of our
concepts, but also in the human will there is a point, be it
ever so small, where a “we,” too real ever to be comprehended
by science or philosophy, can dip down into the stream of
consciousness and delay some fleeting idea, be it only for the
twinkling of an eye, and thereby change the whole course and
significance of our overt action. Freedom must not unequivocally
surrender to scientific determinism, or chance to necessity.</p>

<p>James is a Parsifal to whom the Grail is never quite revealed.
His pragmatism and radical empiricism are but methods
of exploration and no adventure is too puny or mean for
the quest. We must make our ideas clear and test them by the
revelation they produce. Thoughts that make no difference
to us in living are not real thoughts, but imaginings. The way
is always open and perhaps there is a guiding truth, a working
value, in the operations of even the deranged mind. We
must entertain the ecstatic visions of saints, the alleged communications
of spiritualists, mystical contacts with sources of
some higher power, and even the thought-systems of cranks,
that nothing be lost or untried. Not that we need share such
beliefs, but they are genuine experiences and who can foretell
where in experiences some fruitful vision may arise!</p>

<p>As a psychologist, James knew that the significance of a
belief lies not so much in its content as in its power to direct
the energies it releases. His catholic interests are not equivalent
to uncritical credulity. Santayana, the wisest of his critics,
is right in his assertion that James never lost his agnosticism:
“He did not really believe; he merely believed in the right
of believing that you might be right if you believed.” As for
Pascal, the wager on immortality might be worth the making
for if one won there was the blessedness of Heaven, and if one
lost—at least there should have been a sustaining optimism
through the trials of this life. Communion with the infinite
might open new sources of power. If so, the power was there.
If not, no harm had been done by the trial. Yet there is no
evidence in James’ philosophy that he himself drew inspiration
from any of such sources.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>

<p>If James has drawn to himself the greatest reading public
of all American philosophers, it is because in him each man
can find the sanction for himself. Without dogmatism or
pedantry, James is the voice of all individual human experiences.
In him, each man can find a sympathetic auditor, and
words vivid with the language of the street, encouraging his
endeavours or at least pointing out the significance of his experiences
for the great business of living. Sometimes James
listens to human confessions with a suppressed cry of pain and
recalls wistfully “A Certain Blindness in Human Beings,” or
asks “Is Life Worth Living?” Once with indignation at “the
delicate intellectualities and subtleties and scrupulosities” of
philosophy he confronts “the host of guileless thoroughfed
thinkers” with the radical realities of Morrison I. Swift, only
to partially retract a few pages later with the admission, for
him grudgingly given, that the Absolute may afford its believers
a certain comfort and is “in so far forth” true. We live
after all in an open universe, the lid is off and time relentlessly
operates for the production of novelties. No empiricist can
give a decision until the evidence is all in, and in the nature
of the case this can never happen.</p>

<p>Such openness of interest forefends the possibility of James’
founding a school of philosophy. It also renders all his
younger contemporaries in some measure his disciples. Popularly
he is the refuge of the mystics and heterodox, the spiritualists
and the cranks who seek the sanction of academic
scholarship and certified dignity. There are more things in
the philosophies of these who call him master than are dreamed
of in his philosophy. In academic philosophy there is a dual
descent of the James tradition. As a principle of negative
criticism, it may be turned into its opposite, as with Hocking,
who enunciates the extreme form of the pragmatic principle,
If a theory is not interesting, it is false—and utilizes it for
his realistic, mystic, idealistic absolutism. The philosophy of
Henri Bergson, that has been widely read in this country,
reinforces this mystical spiritual side, but American mysticism
has popularly tended to degenerate into the occultisms of
second-rate credulous minds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<p>On the other hand, for those in whom the conflict of science
and religion is settling itself on the side of science, the principle
of pragmatism lends itself to the interpretation originally intended
by Charles Peirce, the author of the term, as an experimentalism,
a search for verifiable hypotheses after the
manner of the sciences. But this side of the doctrine is the
one that has been developed by John Dewey.</p>

<p>Professor Dewey is without question the leading American
philosopher, both from the thoroughness of his analyses and
the vigour of his appeal to the American public. In discarding
the Hegelian Idealism in which he was trained, he is thoroughly
aligned with the New America. In him science has wholly
won, and although of New England, Vermont, ancestry, there
remains not a trace of the New Englander’s romantic spiritual
longings for contact with a vast unknown. His dogmatic
faiths, and no man is without such faiths, relate to evolution,
democracy, and the all-decisive authority of experience.</p>

<p>For Dewey, as for the Realists, psychology is the study of
human behaviour. For him mind is the instrument by which
we overcome obstacles and thinking takes place only when
action is checked. Hence in the conventional sense there are
no abstractions. Our concepts are instruments by which we
take hold of reality. If we need instruments to manufacture
instruments, or to facilitate their use, these instruments are
also concepts. We may call them abstract, but they are not
thereby removed from the realm of experienced fact. Since,
therefore, our real interest is not in things as they are in themselves,
but in what we can do with them, our judgments are
judgments of value, and value is determined by practice. Such
judgments imply an incomplete physical situation and look
toward its completion. But the will to believe is gone. There
is no shadow of James’ faith in the practicality of emotional
satisfactions, or in his voluntaristic psychology. Our “sensations
are not the elements out of which perceptions are
composed, constituted, or constructed; they are the finest,
most carefully discriminated objects of perception.” Early
critics, particularly among the realists, have accused Dewey
of subjectivism, but except in the sense that an individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
must be recognized as one term in the reaction to a situation,
and the realists themselves do this, there is no ground for the
charge.</p>

<p>Such a philosophy as Dewey’s is nothing if it is not put to
work. And here is his greatest hold on American life. Like
most Americans, he has no sympathy for the lazy, and even
the over-reflective may suffer from the contamination of sloth;
the true American wants to see results, and here is a philosophy
in which results are the supreme end. Reform is, for America,
a sort of sport and this philosophy involves nothing but
reform. Metaphysical subtleties and visions leave the busy
man cold; here they are taboo.</p>

<p>Professor Dewey puts his philosophy to work in the fields
of ethics and education. Perhaps his ethics is the least satisfactory,
howsoever promising its beginnings. Moral codes
become the expression of group-approval. But they easily
pass into tradition, get out of touch with fact, are superannuated.
The highest virtue is intelligence and with intelligence
one can recognize the uniqueness of every moral situation
and develop from it its own criteria of judgment. Progress
in morals consists in raising the general level of intelligence
and extending the group whose approvals are significant from
a social class to the nation, a notion of highest appeal to
Democracy, with its faith in the individual man. But with
Dewey the limit of group expansion is humanity, and this may
verge on dangerous (unfortunately) radicalism. Dewey’s
weapon against conventional ethics is two-edged. For the
intelligent man perhaps there is no better actual moral standard
than that springing from intelligent specific judgments,
but for the uneducated, it is only too easy to identify intelligence
with sentimental opinion and to let practice degenerate
into legislative repression.</p>

<p>After all, judgments of practice do face incomplete situations
and the problem is not only to complete but also to determine
the manner in which the completion shall be brought
about. What men transform is not merely the world, but
themselves, and the ethics is incomplete without some further
consideration of such questions as what are human natures,
and what do we want them to become. But perhaps such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
questions are too dangerously near metaphysics to have appealed
to Dewey’s powers of analysis. At any rate, the general
effectiveness of his ethics is weakened by his neglect of
attention to principles in some sense at least ultimate.</p>

<p>In education Dewey’s philosophy has its most complete
vitality, for here he is dealing with concrete needs and the
means of satisfying them. The problem of education is to
integrate knowledge and life. He finds no joy in information
for information’s sake. Curiosity may be the gift of the
child, but it must be utilized to equip the man to hold his own
in a world of industrialism and democracy. Yet Dewey’s sympathies
are with spontaneity. He is a Rousseau with a new
methodology. Connected with the Laboratory School at Chicago
from 1896 to 1903, he has since followed with sympathetic
interest all radical experimentation from the methods of
Madame Montessori to those of the Gary Schools. The vast
erudition amassed in this field, and his careful and unprejudiced
study of children, has made him competent above all men to
speak critically of methods and results.</p>

<p>In regard to education, he has given a fuller consideration
of the ends to be attained than in the case of ethics. The end
is seen as continued growth, springing from the existing conditions,
freeing activity, and flexible in its adaptation to circumstances.
The educational result is social efficiency and
culture. This efficiency does not, however, imply accepting
existing economic conditions as final, and its cultural aspect,
good citizenship, includes with the more specific positive virtues,
those characteristics that make a man a good companion.
Culture is a complete ripening of the personality. “What
is termed spiritual culture has usually been futile, with something
rotten about it, just because it has been conceived as a
thing which a man might have internally—and therefore exclusively.”
The antithesis between sacrificing oneself for
others, or others for oneself, is an unreal figment of the imagination,
a tragic product of certain spiritual and religious
thinking.</p>

<p>Professor Dewey well understands the dangers that lurk
behind such terms as <em>social efficiency</em> and <em>good citizenship</em>.
To him sympathy is much more than a mere feeling: it is, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
he says it should be, “a cultivated imagination for what men
have in common and a rebellion at whatever unnecessarily
divides them.” But his very gift of clear vision, his penetration
of the shams of dogma, economic and social, leads him to treat
these things with scant respect. In consequence his fellow-philosophers,
the educators over whom his influence is profound,
and the public suspect him of radicalism. Only too
often, to avoid suspicion of themselves, they turn his doctrine
to the very uses that he condemns: industrial efficiency for
them becomes identical with business expedience; the school, a
trade school; culture, a detached æstheticism to be condemned;
and democracy, the privilege of thinking and acting like everybody
else.</p>

<p>The greatest weakness of Dewey’s philosophy, and it is
serious, for Dewey as no other American philosopher grasps
principles through which American civilization might be transformed
for the better—lies in its lack of a metaphysics. Not,
of course, a transcendentalism or a religious mysticism, but
above all an interpretation of human nature. Emotionality
represents a phase of the behaviour process too real to deny,
yet it has no place in Dewey’s philosophy of man. Human
longings and aspirations are facts as real as the materials of
industry. Most men remain religious. Must they rest with
quack mystics or unintelligent dogmatists? What is religion
giving them that they crave? Is it a form of art, an attitude
toward the ideal, or some interpretation of the forces of nature
that they seek to grasp? Professor Dewey is himself a
lover of art, but what place has art in his philosophy? If
it is an instrument of education, what end does it serve, and
how is it to be utilized? The pragmatic ethics gives no guarantee
that the moral criteria developed by specific situations
will always be the same even for two men equally intelligent.
Perhaps, in spite of the paradox, there may be several best
solutions. If so, this fact has some significance rooted in
man’s nature and his relations to the world that philosophy
should disclose. Such supplementation need not change the
character of the results, but it might forefend them from misinterpretation
and abuse.</p>

<p>With all its incompleteness, Dewey’s philosophy is undeniably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
that of the America of to-day. What shall we say of the
future? No nation in the world has more abused its philosophies
than ours. The inspirational elements of our idealisms
have become the panderings of sentimentalists. The vitalizing
forces of our pragmatisms threaten to congeal into the dogmata
of cash-success. The war has intensified our national self-satisfaction.
We tend to condemn all vision as radical, hence
unsound, hence evil, hence to be put down. Philosophy thrives
in the atmosphere of the Bacchæ:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“What else is Wisdom? What of man’s endeavour</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Or God’s high grace, so lovely and so great?</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">To stand from fear set free, to breathe and wait;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">To hold a hand uplifted over Hate;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shall not loveliness be loved for ever?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">But what have we now of this atmosphere?</p>

<p>At Christmas-time, the American Philosophical Association
devoted three sessions to the discussion of the Rôle of the
Philosopher in Modern Life. From report, opinion was divided
between those who would have him a social reformer,
to the exclusion of contemplative background, and those with
a greater sense of playing safe, who would have him turn to
history, of any sort, or contemplation quite detached from
social consequences. Let us hope these opinions are not to
be taken seriously. Our social reformers are not all like
Dewey, whose neglect of basic reflection is probably not as
great as the omission of such reflections from his published
works would indicate. Nor is an academic chair generally
suited to the specific contacts with life from which successful
reforms must be shaped. On the other hand, abstract contemplation
with the pedagogic reinforcements advocated, will confirm
the popular American sentiment against reflection, if it is
true, as Dewey asserts, that education must be an outgrowth
of existing conditions. Fortunately genius, if such there be
amongst us, will not submit to the opinions of the American
Philosophic Association. If philosophy can find freedom, perhaps
America can yet find philosophy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_LITERARY_LIFE">THE LITERARY LIFE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Among</span> all the figures which, in Mrs. Wharton’s “The Age
of Innocence,” make up the pallid little social foreground,
the still more pallid middle distance, of the New York of forty
years ago, there is none more pallid than the figure of Ned
Winsett, the “man of letters untimely born in a world that
had no need of letters.” Winsett, we are told, “had published
one volume of brief and exquisite literary appreciations,” of
which one hundred and twenty copies had been sold, and had
then abandoned his calling and taken an obscure post on a
women’s weekly. “On the subject of <em>Hearth-fires</em> (as the
paper was called) he was inexhaustibly entertaining,” says Mrs.
Wharton; “but beneath his fun lurked the sterile bitterness of
the still young man who has tried and given up.” Sterile bitterness,
a bright futility, a beginning without a future: that
is the story of Ned Winsett.</p>

<p>One feels, as one turns Mrs. Wharton’s pages, how symbolic
this is of the literary life in America. I shall say nothing
of the other arts, though the vital conditions of all the arts
have surely much in common; I shall say nothing of America
before the Civil War, for the America that New England dominated
was a different nation from ours. But what immediately
strikes one, as one surveys the history of our literature during
the last half century, is the singular impotence of its creative
spirit. That we have and have always had an abundance of
talent is, I think, no less evident: what I mean is that so little
of this talent succeeds in effectuating itself. Of how many
of our modern writers can it be said that their work reveals
a continuous growth, or indeed any growth, that they hold their
ground tenaciously and preserve their sap from one decade to
another? Where, to speak relatively, the characteristic evolution
of the European writer is one of an ever-increasing differentiation,
a progress toward the creation, the possession of a
world absolutely his own (the world of Shaw, the world of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
Hardy, the world of Hamsun, of Gorky, of Anatole France),
the American writer, having struck out with his new note,
becomes—how often!—progressively less and less himself.
The blighted career, the arrested career, the diverted career
are, with us, the rule. The chronic state of our literature is
that of a youthful promise which is never redeemed.</p>

<p>The great writer, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grand écrivain</i>, has at the best of times
appeared but once or twice in America: that is another matter.
I am speaking, as I say, of the last half century, and I
am speaking of the rank and file. There are those who will
deny this characterization of our literature, pointing to what
they consider the robust and wholesome corpus of our “normal”
fiction. But this fiction, in its way, precisely corroborates
my point. What is the quality of the spirit behind it?
How much does it contain of that creative element the character
of which consists in dominating life instead of being
dominated by it? Have these novelists of ours any world of
their own as distinguished from the world they observe and
reflect, the world they share with their neighbours? Is it a
personal vision that informs them, or a mob-vision? The
Danish writer, Johannes V. Jensen, has described their work
as “journalism under exceptionally fortunate conditions.”
Journalism, on the whole, it assuredly is, and the chief of these
fortunate conditions (fortunate for journalism!) has been the
general failure of the writers in question to establish and develop
themselves as individuals; as they have rendered unto
Cæsar what was intended for God, is it any wonder that Cæsar
has waxed so fat? “The unfortunate thing,” writes Mr. Montrose
J. Moses, “is that the American drama”—but the observation
is equally true of this fiction of ours—“has had many
brilliant promises which have finally thinned out and never
materialized.” And again: “The American dramatist has
always taken his logic second-hand; he has always allowed his
theatrical sense to be a slave to managerial circumstance.” The
two statements are complementary, and they apply, as I say, to
the whole of this “normal” literature of ours. Managerial
circumstance? Let us call it local patriotism, the spirit of the
times, the hunger of the public for this, that, or the other:
to some one of these demands, these promptings from without,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
the “normal” American writer always allows himself to become
a slave. It is the fact, indeed, of his being a slave to
some demand from without that makes him “normal”—and
something else than an artist.</p>

<p>The flourishing exterior of the main body of our contemporary
literature, in short, represents anything but the integrity
of an inner well-being. But even aside from this, one can
count on one’s two hands the American writers who are able
to carry on the development and unfolding of their individualities,
year in, year out, as every competent man of affairs
carries on his business. What fate overtakes the rest? Shall
I begin to run over some of those names, familiar to us all,
names that have signified so much promise and are lost in what
Gautier calls “the limbo where moan (in the company of
babes) still-born vocations, abortive attempts, larvæ of ideas
that have won neither wings nor shapes”? Shall I mention
the writers—but they are countless!—who have lapsed into
silence, or have involved themselves in barren eccentricities,
or have been turned into machines? The poets who, at the
very outset of their careers, find themselves extinguished like
so many candles? The novelists who have been unable to
grow up, and remain withered boys of seventeen? The critics
who find themselves overtaken in mid-career by a hardening
of the spiritual arteries? Our writers all but universally lack
the power of growth, the endurance that enables one to continue
to produce personal work after the freshness of youth
has gone. Weeds and wild flowers! Weeds without beauty
or fragrance, and wild flowers that cannot survive the heat of
the day.</p>

<p>Such is the aspect of our contemporary literature; beside
that of almost any European country, it is indeed one long list
of spiritual casualties. For it is not that the talent is wanting,
but that somehow this talent fails to fulfil itself.</p>

<p>This being so, how much one would like to assume, with
certain of our critics, that the American writer is a sort of
Samson bound with the brass fetters of the Philistines and
requiring only to have those fetters cast off in order to be able
to conquer the world! That, as I understand it, is the position
of Mr. Dreiser, who recently remarked of certain of our novelists:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
“They succeeded in writing but one book before the
iron hand of convention took hold of them.” There is this
to be said for the argument, that if the American writer as a
type shows less resistance than the European writer it is plainly
because he has been insufficiently equipped, stimulated, nourished
by the society into which he has been born. In this sense
the American environment is answerable for the literature it
has produced. But what is significant is that the American
writer <em>does</em> show less resistance; as literature is nothing but the
expression of power, of the creative will, of “free will,” in
short, is it not more accurate to say, not that the “iron hand
of convention” takes hold of our writers, but that our writers
yield to the “iron hand of convention”? Samson had lost his
virility before the Philistines bound him; it was because he
had lost his virility that the Philistines were able to bind him.
The American writer who “goes wrong” is in a similar case.
“I have read,” says Mr. Dreiser, of Jack London, “several
short stories which proved what he could do. But he did not
feel that he cared for want and public indifference. Hence his
many excellent romances.” <em>He did not feel that he cared for
want and public indifference.</em> Even Mr. Dreiser, as we observe,
determinist that he is, admits a margin of free will,
for he represents Jack London as having made a choice. What
concerns us now, however, is not a theoretical but a practical
question, the fact, namely, that the American writer as a rule
is actuated not by faith but by fear, that he cannot meet the
obstacles of “want and public indifference” as the European
writer meets them, that he is, indeed, and as if by nature, a
journeyman and a hireling.</p>

<p>As we see, then, the creative will in this country is a very
weak and sickly plant. Of the innumerable talents that are
always emerging about us there are few that come to any sort
of fruition: the rest wither early; they are transformed into
those neuroses that flourish on our soil as orchids flourish in
the green jungle. The sense of this failure is written all over
our literature. Do we not know what depths of disappointment
underlay the cynicism of Mark Twain and Henry Adams
and Ambrose Bierce? Have we failed to recognize, in the
surly contempt with which the author of “The Story of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
Country Town” habitually speaks of writers and writing, the
unconscious cry of sour grapes of a man whose creative life
was arrested in youth? Are we unaware of the bitterness with
which, in certain letters of his later years, Jack London
regretted the miscarriage of his gift? There is no denying
that for half a century the American writer as a type has gone
down in defeat.</p>

<p>Now why is this so? Why does the American writer, relatively
speaking, show less resistance than the European writer?
Plainly, as I have just said, because he has been insufficiently
equipped, stimulated, nourished by the society into which he
has been born. If our creative spirits are unable to grow
and mature, it is a sign that there is something wanting in the
soil from which they spring and in the conditions that surround
them. Is it not, for that matter, a sign of some more general
failure in our life?</p>

<p>“At the present moment,” wrote Mr. Chesterton in one of
his early essays (“The Fallacy of the Young Nation”),
struck by the curious anæmia of those few artists of ours who
have succeeded in developing themselves, usually by escaping
from the American environment; “at the present moment the
matter which America has very seriously to consider is not
how near it is to its birth and beginning, but how near it
may be to its end.... The English colonies have produced
no great artists, and that fact may prove that they are still
full of silent possibilities and reserve force. But America
has produced great artists and that fact most certainly means
that she is full of a fine futility and the end of all things.
Whatever the American men of genius are, they are not young
gods making a young world. Is the art of Whistler a brave,
barbaric art, happy and headlong? Does Mr. Henry James
infect us with the spirit of a school-boy? No, the colonies
have not spoken, and they are safe. Their silence may be
the silence of the unborn. But out of America has come a
sweet and startling cry, as unmistakable as the cry of a dying
man.” That there is truth behind this, that the soil of our
society is at least arid and impoverished, is indicated by the
testimony of our own poets; one has only to consider what
George Cabot Lodge wrote in 1904, in one of his letters: “We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
are a dying race, as every race must be of which the men are,
as men and not accumulators, third-rate”; one has only to
consider the writings of Messrs. Frost, Robinson, and Masters,
in whose presentation of our life, in the West as well as in
the East, the individual as a spiritual unit invariably suffers
defeat. Fifty years ago J. A. Froude, on a visit to this country,
wrote to one of his friends: “From what I see of the
Eastern states I do not anticipate any very great things as
likely to come out of the Americans.... They are generous
with their money, have much tenderness and quiet good humour;
but the Anglo-Saxon power is running to seed and I
don’t think will revive.” When we consider the general colourlessness
and insipidity of our latter-day life (faithfully
reflected in the novels of Howells and his successors), the
absence from it of profound passions and intense convictions,
of any representative individuals who can be compared in spiritual
force with Emerson, Thoreau, and so many of their contemporaries,
its uniformity and its uniform tepidity, then the
familiar saying, “Our age has been an age of management,
not of ideas or of men,” assumes indeed a very sinister import.
I go back to the poet Lodge’s letters. “Was there ever,” he
writes, “such an anomaly as the American man? In practical
affairs his cynicism, energy, and capacity are simply stupefying,
and in every other respect he is a sentimental idiot possessing
neither the interest, the capacity, nor the desire for
even the most elementary processes of independent thought....
His wife finds him so sexually inapt that she refuses to
bear him children and so drivelling in every way except as a
money-getter that she compels him to expend his energies solely
in that direction while she leads a discontented, sterile, stunted
life....” Is this to be denied? And does it not in part
explain that extraordinary lovelessness of the American scene
which has bred the note of a universal resentment in so much
of our contemporary fiction? As well expect figs from thistles
as any considerable number of men from such a soil who are
robust enough to prefer spiritual to material victories and who
are capable of achieving them.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to go back to Taine in order to realize
that here we have a matrix as unpropitious as possible for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
literature and art. If our writers wither early, if they are too
generally pliant, passive, acquiescent, anæmic, how much is
this not due to the heritage of pioneering, with its burden
of isolation, nervous strain, excessive work and all the racial
habits that these have engendered?</p>

<p>Certainly, for example, if there is anything that counts in
the formation of the creative spirit it is that long infancy to
which John Fiske, rightly or wrongly, attributed the emergence
of man from the lower species. In the childhood of almost
every great writer one finds this protracted incubation, this
slow stretch of years in which the unresisting organism opens
itself to the influences of life. It was so with Hawthorne, it
was so with Whitman in the pastoral America of a century
ago: they were able to mature, these brooding spirits, because
they had given themselves for so long to life before they
began to react upon it. That is the old-world childhood still,
in a measure; how different it is from the modern American
childhood may be seen if one compares, for example, the first
book (“Boyhood”) of “Pelle the Conqueror” with any of
those innumerable tales in which our novelists show us that
in order to succeed in life one cannot be up and doing too
soon. The whole temper of our society, if one is to judge
from these documents, is to hustle the American out of his
childhood, teaching him at no age at all how to repel life and
get the best of it and build up the defences behind which he is
going to fight for his place in the sun. Who can deny that
this racial habit succeeds in its unconscious aim, which is to
produce sharp-witted men of business? But could anything
be deadlier to the poet, the artist, the writer?</p>

<p>Everything in such an environment, it goes without saying,
tends to repress the creative and to stimulate the competitive
impulses. A certain Irish poet has observed that all he ever
learned of poetry he got from talking with peasants along the
road. Whitman might have said almost as much, even of
New York, the New York of seventy years ago. But what
nourishment do they offer the receptive spirit to-day, the
harassed, inhibited mob of our fellow-countrymen, eaten up
with the “itch of ill-advised activity,” what encouragement to
become anything but an automaton like themselves? And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
what direction, in such a society, does the instinct of emulation
receive, that powerful instinct of adolescence? A certain
visitor of Whitman’s has described him as living in a house
“as cheerless as an ash-barrel,” a house indeed “like that in
which a very destitute mechanic” might have lived. Is it not
symbolic, that picture, of the esteem in which our democracy
holds the poet? If to-day the man of many dollars is no
longer the hero of the editorial page and the baccalaureate
address, still, or rather more than ever, it is the “aggressive”
type that overshadows every corner of our civilization; the
intellectual man who has gone his own way and refused to
flatter the majority was never less the hero or even the subject
of intelligent interest; at best ignored, at worst (and usually)
pointed out as a crank, he is only a “warning” to youth,
which is exceedingly susceptible in these matters. But how
can one begin to enumerate the elements in our society that
contribute to form a selection constantly working against the
survival of the creative type? By cutting off the sources that
nourish it, by lending prestige to the acquisitive and destroying
the glamour of the creative career, everything in America
conspires to divert the spirit from its natural course, seizing
upon the instincts of youth and turning them into a single
narrow channel.</p>

<p>Here, of course, I touch upon the main fact of American
history. That traditional drag, if one may so express it, in
the direction of the practical, which has been the law of our
civilization, would alone explain why our literature and art
have never been more than half-hearted. To abandon the
unpopular and unremunerative career of painting for the useful
and lucrative career of invention must have seemed natural
and inevitable to Robert Fulton and Samuel Morse. So strong
is this racial compulsion, so feeble is the hold which Americans
have upon ultimate values, that one can scarcely find to-day a
scientist or a scholar who, for the sake of science or scholarship,
will refuse an opportunity to become the money-gathering president
of some insignificant university. Thus our intellectual
life has always been ancillary to the life of business and organization:
have we forgotten that the good Washington Irving
himself, the father of American letters, thought it by no means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
beneath his dignity to serve as a sort of glorified press-agent
for John Jacob Astor?</p>

<p>It is certainly true that none of these unfavourable factors
of American life could have had such a baleful effect upon our
literature if there had been others to counteract them. An
aristocratic tradition, if we had ever had it, would have kept
open among us the right of way of the free individual, would
have preserved the claims of mere living. “It is curious to observe,”
writes Nietzsche in one of his letters, “how any one
who soon leaves the traditional highway in order to travel on
his own proper path always has more or less the sense of being
an exile, a condemned criminal, a fugitive from mankind.”
If that is true in the old world, where society is so much more
complex and offers the individual so much more latitude, how
few could ever have had the strength in a society like ours,
which has always placed such an enormous premium on conformity,
to become and to remain themselves? Is it fanciful
indeed to see in the famous “remorse” of Poe the traces left
by this dereliction of the tribal law upon the unconscious mind
of an artist of unique force and courage? Similarly, a tradition
of voluntary poverty would have provided us with an escape
from the importunities of bourgeois custom. But aside
from the fact that even so simple a principle as this depends
largely for its life on precedent (Whitman and the painter
Ryder are almost alone among latter-day Americans in having
discovered it for themselves), aside from the fact that to secede
from the bourgeois system is, in America, to subject oneself to
peculiar penalties (did it ever occur to Mark Twain that he
<em>could</em> be honourably poor?)—aside from all this, poverty in
the new world is by no means the same thing as poverty in the
old: one has only to think of Charles Lamb and all the riches
that London freely gave him, all the public resources he had
at his disposal, to appreciate the difference. With us poverty
means in the end an almost inevitable intellectual starvation.
Consider such a plaint as Sidney Lanier’s: “I could never describe
to you” (he writes to Bayard Taylor) “what a mere
drought and famine my life has been, as regards that multitude
of matters which I fancy one absorbs when one is in an
atmosphere of art, or when one is in conversational relationship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
with men of letters, with travellers, with persons who have
either seen, or written, or done large things. Perhaps you
know that, with us of the younger generation in the South
since the war, pretty much the whole of life has been merely
not dying.” That is what poverty means in America, poverty
and isolation, for Lanier, whose talent, as we can see to-day,
was hopelessly crippled by it, was mistaken if he supposed
that there was anything peculiar to the South in that plight of
his: it has been the plight of the sensitive man everywhere in
America and at all times. Add to poverty the want of a society
devoted to intellectual things and we have such a fate as
Herman Melville’s in New York. “What he lacked,” wrote
Mr. Frank Jewett Mather the other day, explaining the singular
evaporation of Melville’s talent, “was possibly only health
and nerve, but perhaps even more, companionship of a friendly,
critical, understanding sort. In London, where he must have
been hounded out of his corner, I can imagine Melville carrying
the reflective vein to literary completion.” Truly Samuel
Butler was right when he jotted down the following observation
in his note-book: “America will have her geniuses, as
every other country has, in fact she has already had one in
Walt Whitman, but I do not think America is a good place in
which to be a genius. A genius can never expect to have a
good time anywhere, if he is a genuine article, but America is
about the last place in which life will be endurable at all for
an inspired writer of any kind.”</p>

<p>To such circumstances as these, I say, the weakness of our
literary life is due. If we had lacked nothing else indeed, the
lack of great leaders, of a strong and self-respecting literary
guild, even of an enlightened publishing system would have
sufficed to account for much of it. To consider the last point
first: in the philosophy of American publishing, popularity has
been regarded not only as a practical advantage but as a virtue
as well. Thanks to the peculiar character of our democracy,
our publishers have been able to persuade themselves
that a book which fails to appeal to the ordinary citizen cannot
be good on other grounds. Thus, if we had had to depend
on the established system, the present revival in our letters,
tentative as it is, would have been still more sadly handicapped.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
The history of Mr. Dreiser’s “Sister Carrie” is
enough to suggest what may well have been the fate of many
an incipient author less persistent than he. It is certain, in
any case, that many another, at a critical moment, has drifted
away from literature because of the lack in our publishing
world of those opportunities for a semi-creative hack-work
which have provided countless European writers with a foothold
and even a guideway. The Grub Street of London and
Paris is a purgatory, but as long as it exists, with its humble
instrumentalities, translating, editing, reviewing, one can at
least survive until one has either lost or found oneself: it
scarcely needs to be pointed out that the American magazine,
with its mechanical exactions, which levy such a terrible toll
upon one’s individuality, is anything but an advantageous substitute.
Till one has found oneself, the less one is subjected to
such powerful, such essentially depolarizing influences, the better;
the most mediocre institutions, if they enable one at the
same time to maintain one’s contact with literature and to keep
body and soul together, are as life is to death beside them. How
many English writers owe their ultimate salvation to such
trivial agencies as <cite>T. P.’s Weekly</cite>? In America, where
nothing of the kind has existed until lately, or nothing adequate
to the number of those who might have benefitted by it,
the literary aspirant is lost unless his powers mature at once.</p>

<p>But the lack of great leaders, of a strong and self-respecting
literary guild (the one results from the other)—is not this
our chief misfortune? In the best of circumstances, and considering
all the devils that beset the creative spirit, a strong
impulse is scarcely enough to carry one through: one must
feel not only that one is doing what one wishes to do but that
what one is doing <em>matters</em>. If dozens of American writers
have fallen by the wayside because they have met with insuperable
obstacles, dozens of others have fallen, with all their
gifts, because they have lost interest in their work, because
they have ceased to “see the necessity” of it. This is just
the point where the presence of a leader, of a local tradition,
a school, a guild makes all the difference. “With the masters
I converse,” writes Gauguin in his journal. “Their example
fortifies me. When I am tempted to falter I blush before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
them.” If that could have been true of Gauguin, the “Wolf,”
who walked by himself as few have walked, what shall we say
of other men whose artistic integrity, whose faith in themselves,
is exposed every day to the corroding influences of a
third-rate civilization? It would be all very well if literature
were merely a mode of “having a good time;” I am speaking
of those, the real artists, who, with Nietzsche, make a distinction
(illusory perhaps) between “happiness” and “work,”
and I say that these men have always fed on the thought of
greatness and on the propinquity of greatness. It was not
for nothing that Turgeniev bore in his memory, as a talisman,
the image of Pushkin; that Gorky, having seen Tolstoy once,
sitting among the boulders on the seashore, felt everything
in him blending in one happy thought, “I am not an
orphan on the earth, so long as this man lives on it.” The
presence of such men immeasurably raises the morale of the
literary life: that is what Chekhov meant when he said, “I
am afraid of Tolstoy’s death,” and is it not true that the whole
contemporary literature of England has drawn virtue from
Thomas Hardy? The sense that one is <em>working in a great line</em>:
this, more than anything else perhaps, renews one’s confidence
in the “quaint mania of passing one’s life wearing oneself out
over words,” as Flaubert called it, in the still greater folly of
pursuing one’s ego when everything in life combines to punish
one for doing so. The successful pursuit of the ego is what
makes literature; this requires not only a certain inner intensity
but a certain courage, and it is doubtful whether, in any
nation, any considerable number of men can summon up that
courage and maintain it unless they have <em>seen the thing done</em>.
The very notion that such a life is either possible or desirable,
the notion that such a life exists even, can hardly occur to the
rank and file: some individual has to start the ball rolling,
some individual of extraordinary force and audacity, and where
is that individual to be found in our modern American literature?
Whitman is the unique instance, for Henry James, with
all his admirable conscience, was at once an exile and a man
of singularly low vitality; and Whitman was not only essentially
of an earlier generation, he was an invalid who folded
his hands in mid-career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>

<p>Of those others what can we say, those others whose gifts
have fitted them to be our leaders? Mr. Howells once observed
of the American drama of the last few decades that
“mainly it has been gay as our prevalent mood is, mainly it
has been honest, as our habit is, in cases where we believe we
can afford it.” In this gently ironical pleasantry one seems to
discern the true spirit of modern American letters. But it was
Howells himself who, in order to arrive at the doctrine that
“the more smiling aspects of life are the more American,” deliberately,
as he has told us, and professed realist that he was,
averted his eyes from the darker side of life. And Mark Twain
suppressed his real beliefs about man and the universe. And
Henry Adams refused to sponsor in public the novels that revealed
what he considered to be the truth about American society.
Thus spake Zarathustra: “There is no harsher misfortune
in all the fate of man than when the mighty ones of
earth are not also the most excellent.” At its very headwaters,
as we see, this modern literature of ours has failed to flow
clear: the creative impulse in these men, richly endowed as
they were, was checked and compromised by too many other
impulses, social and commercial. If one is to blame anything
for this it is the immense insecurity of our life, which is due
to its chaotic nature; for one is not entitled to expect greatness
even of those who have the greatest gifts, and of these
men Henry Adams was alone secure; of Howells and Mark
Twain, Westerners as they were, it may be said that they were
obliged to compromise, consciously or unconsciously, in order
to gain a foothold in the only corner of the country where men
could exist as writers at all. But if these men were unable
to establish their independence (one has only to recall the notorious
Gorky dinner in order to perceive the full ignominy of
their position), what must one expect to find in the rank and
file? Great men form a sort of wind shield behind which the
rest of their profession are able to build up their own defences;
they establish a right of way for the others; they command a
respect for their profession, they arouse in the public a concern
for it, an interest in it, from which the others benefit. As
things are, the literary guild in America is not respected, nor
does it respect itself. In “My Literary Passions” Howells,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
after saying that his early reading gave him no standing among
other boys, observes: “I have since found that literature gives
one no more certain station in the world of men’s activities,
either idle or useful. We literary folk try to believe that it
does, but that is all nonsense. At every period of life among
boys or men we are accepted when they are at leisure and
want to be amused, and at best we are tolerated rather than
accepted.” Pathetic? Pusillanimous? Abject? Pathetic, I
suppose. Imagine Maxim Gorky or Knut Hamsun or Bernard
Shaw “trying to believe” that literature gives him a certain
station in the world of men’s activities, conceiving for a moment
that any activity could exceed his in dignity! Howells,
we observe, conscientious craftsman as he was, instinctively
shared, in regard to the significance of his vocation, the feeling
of our pragmatic philosophers, who have been obliged to
justify the intellectual life by showing how useful it is—not to
mention Mr. R. W. Chambers, who has remarked that writers
“are not held in excessive esteem by really busy people, the
general idea being—which is usually true—that literature is a
godsend to those unfitted for real work.” After this one can
easily understand why our novelists take such pains to be mistaken
for business men and succeed so admirably in their effort.
One can easily understand why Jack London preferred
the glory of his model ranch and his hygienic pigsties to the
approval of his artistic conscience.</p>

<p>So much for the conditions, or at least a few of them, that
have prevented our literature from getting its head above
water. If America is littered with extinct talents, the halt, the
maimed and the blind, it is for reasons with which we are all
too familiar; and we to whom the creative life is nothing less
than the principle of human movement, and its welfare the true
sign of human health, look upon this wreckage of everything
that is most precious to society and ask ourselves what our
fathers meant when they extolled the progress of our civilization.
But let us look facts in the face. Mr. Sinclair Lewis
asserts that we are in the midst of a revival and that we are
too humble in supposing that our contemporary literature is
inferior to that of England. That we are in the midst of a
revival I have no doubt, but it is the sustained career that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
makes a literature; without the evidence of this we can hope
much but we can affirm nothing. What we can see is that,
with all its hope, the morale of the literary profession in this
country is just what its antecedents have made it. I am reminded
of the observation of a friend who has reason to know,
that the Catholic Church in America, great as it is in numbers
and organization, still depends on the old world for its models,
its task-masters and its inspiration; for the American priest,
as a rule, does not feel the vocation as the European feels it.
I am reminded of the American labour movement which, prosperous
as it is in comparison with the labour movements of
Europe, is unparalleled for the feebleness of its representatives.
I am reminded of certain brief experiences in the American
university world which have led me to believe that the professors
who radiate a genuine light and warmth are far more
likely to be Russians, Germans, Englishmen, Irishmen, Dutchmen,
Swedes and Finns than the children of ’76. That old
hostility of the pioneers to the special career still operates to
prevent in the American mind the powerful, concentrated pursuit
of any non-utilitarian way of life: meanwhile everything
else in our society tends to check the growth of the spirit and
to shatter the confidence of the individual in himself. Considered
with reference to its higher manifestations, life itself has
been thus far, in modern America, a failure. Of this the
failure of our literature is merely emblematic.</p>

<p>Mr. Mencken, who shares this belief, urges that the only
hope of a change for the better lies in the development of a
native aristocracy that will stand between the writer and the
public, supporting him, appreciating him, forming as it were
a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cordon sanitaire</i> between the individual and the mob. That
no change can come without the development of an aristocracy
of some sort, some nucleus of the more gifted, energetic and
determined, one can hardly doubt. But how can one expect
the emergence of an aristocracy outside of the creative class,
and devoted to its welfare, unless and until the creative class
itself reveals the sort of pride that can alone attract its ministrations?
“The notion that a people can run itself and its
affairs anonymously is now well known to be the silliest of absurdities.”
Thus William James, in defence of the aristocratic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
principle; and what he says is as applicable to literature as to
every other department of social life. But he continues:
“Mankind does nothing save through initiatives on the part
of inventors, great and small, and imitation by the rest of us—these
are the sole factors alive in human progress. Individuals
of genius show the way, and set the patterns, which common
people then adopt and follow.” In other words, as I understand
it, and so far as literature is concerned, the burden of
proof lies on the writer himself—which brings one back to a
truism: it is not for the public or any aristocratic minority
within the public to understand the writer, it is for the writer
to create the taste by which he is understood. Is it not by
this indeed (in a measure, at least) that we recognize the
creator?</p>

<p>Certainly if our contemporary literature is not respected, if
it has not been able to rally to its support the sensitive public
that already exists in this country, it is partly because this
literature has not respected itself. That there has been every
reason for it makes no difference; that it has begun to respect
itself again makes no difference either, for when a people has
lost confidence in its literature, and has had grounds for losing
confidence in it, one cannot be surprised if it insists a little cynically
upon being “shown.” The public supported Mark
Twain and Howells and the men of their generation, it admired
them for what was admirable in them, but it was aware,
if only unconsciously, that there was a difference between them
and the men of the generation before them; and in consequence
of this the whole stock of American literature fell. But those
who insist in our day that America prefers European writers
to its own, because America is still a colony of Europe, cannot
ignore the significant fact that at a time when America was
still more truly colonial than it is now American writers had
all the prestige in this country that European writers have at
present; and it is not entirely because at that time the country
was more homogeneous. Poe and Thoreau found little support
in the generation of which I speak, as Whitman found
little support in the generation that followed it. On the other
hand, there were no European writers (and it was an age of
great writers in Europe) who were held in higher esteem in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
this country than Hawthorne, Emerson, Motley, and one or
two others almost equally distinguished, as well from a European
as from an American point of view; there were few, if
any, European writers, in fact, who were esteemed in this
country as highly as they. How can one explain it? How can
one explain why, at a time when America, in every other department
of life, was more distinctly colonial than it is now,
American literature commanded the full respect of Americans,
while to-day, when the colonial tradition is vanishing all about
us, it so little commands their respect that they go after any
strange god from England? The problem is not a simple one,
but among the many explanations of it one can hardly deny
that there were in that period a number of writers of unusual
power, who made the most (who were able to make the most)
of their power, who followed their artistic conscience (who
were able to follow it) and who by this fact built up a public
confidence in themselves and in the literature they represented.
Does it matter at all whether to-day we enjoy these writers or
not? They were men of spiritual force, three or four of them:
that is the important point. If the emerging writers of our
epoch find themselves handicapped by the scepticism of the
public, which has ceased to believe that any good thing can
come out of Nazareth, let them remember not only that they
are themselves for the most part in the formative stage, but
that they have to live down the recent past of their profession.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what constitutes a literature is the spiritual force
of the individuals who compose it. If our literature is ever to
be regenerated, therefore, it can only be through the development
of a sense of “free will” (and of the responsibility that
this entails) on the part of our writers themselves. To be, to
feel oneself, a “victim” is in itself not to be an artist, for it
is the nature of the artist to live, not in the world of which he
is an effect, but in the world of which he is the cause, the world
of his own creation. For this reason, the pessimistic determinism
of the present age is, from the point of view of literature,
of a piece with the optimistic determinism of the age that
is passing. What this pessimistic determinism reveals, however,
is a <em>consciousness of the situation</em>: to that extent it represents
a gain, and one may even say that to be conscious of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
the situation is half the battle. If we owed nothing else to Mr.
Dreiser, for instance, we should owe him enough for the tragic
sense of the waste and futility of American life, as we know
it, which his books communicate. It remains true that in so
far as we resent this life it is a sign of our own weakness, of
the harm not only that our civilization has done us but that
we have permitted it to do us, of our own imperfectly realized
freedom; for to the creative spirit in its free state the external
world is merely an impersonal point of departure. Thus it is
certain that as long as the American writer shares what James
Bryce calls the “mass fatalism” of the American people, our
literature will remain the sterile, supine, and inferior phenomenon
which, on the whole, it is.</p>

<p>“What we want,” wrote Henry Adams in 1862 to his brother
Charles, “is a <em>school</em>. We want a national set of young men
like ourselves or better, to start new influences not only in politics,
but in literature, in law, in society, and throughout the
whole social organism of the country—a national school of our
own generation. And that is what America has no power to
create.... It’s all random, insulated work, for special and
temporary and personal purposes. And we have no means,
power or hope of combined action for any unselfish end.”
<em>That is what America has no power to create.</em> But can it be
said that any nation has ever created a school? Here we have
the perfect illustration of that mass fatalism of which I have
spoken, and Henry Adams himself, in his passivity, is the type
of it. Secure as he was, uniquely secure, why did he refuse
to accept the responsibility of those novels in which he expressed
the contempt of a powerful and cultivated mind for
the meanness, the baseness, the vulgarity of the guiding element
in American society? In the darkest and most chaotic
hours of our spiritual history the individual has possessed a
measure of free will only to renounce it: if Henry Adams had
merely signed his work and accepted the consequences of it, he
might by that very fact have become the founder, the centre,
of the school that he desired. But it is true that in that generation
the impulses of youth were, with an extraordinary
unanimity, focused upon a single end, the exploitation of the
continent; the material opportunities that American life offered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
were too great and too all-engrossing, and it is unlikely that
any considerable minority could have been rallied for any non-utilitarian
cause. Sixty years later this school remains, and
quite particularly as regards our literature, the one thing necessary;
the reforestation of our spiritual territory depends on
it. And in more than one sense the times are favourable. The
closing of the frontier seems to promise for this country an intenser
life than it has known before; a large element of the
younger generation, estranged from the present order, exists
in a state of ferment that renders it highly susceptible to new
ideas; the country literally swarms with half-artists, as one
may call them, men and women, that is to say, who have ceased
to conform to the law of the tribe but who have not accepted
the discipline of their own individual spirits. “What I chiefly
desire for you,” wrote Ibsen to Brandes at the outset of his
career, “is a genuine, full-blooded egoism, which shall force
you for a time to regard what concerns you yourself as the
only thing of any consequence, and everything else as non-existent....
There is no way in which you can benefit society
more than by coining the metal you have in yourself.”
The second half of this rather blunt counsel of perfection is
implied in the first, and it connotes a world of things merely
to name which would be to throw into relief the essential infantility
of the American writer as we know the type. By
what prodigies of alert self-adaptation, of discriminating self-scrutiny,
of conscious effort does the creative will come into
its own! As for us, weak as too many of us are, ignorant, isolated,
all too easily satisfied, and scarcely as yet immune from
the solicitations of the mob, we still have this advantage, that
an age of reaction is an age that stirs the few into a consciousness
of themselves.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MUSIC">MUSIC</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">We</span> spend more money upon music than does any other
nation on earth; some of our orchestras, notably those
of Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia, are worthy to rank
among the world’s best; in the Metropolitan Opera House we
give performances of grand opera that for consistent excellence
of playing, singing, and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mise-en-scène</i> are surpassed probably
nowhere. Yet there has never been a successful opera
by an American offered at that opera house, and the number
of viable American orchestral works is small enough to be
counted almost upon one’s fingers. We squander millions
every year upon an art that we cannot produce.</p>

<p>There are apologists for the American composer who will
say that we do produce it, but that it is strangled at birth.
According to their stock argument, there are numberless greatly
gifted native composers whose works never get a hearing, (a)
because Americans are prejudiced against American music and
in favour of foreign music, and (b) because the foreigners
who largely control the musical situation in this country jealously
refuse to allow American works to be performed. This
would be impressive if it were consistent or true. As far as
concerns the Jealous Foreigner myth—he does not dominate
the musical situation—I have never noticed that the average
European in this country is deficient either in self-interest or
tact. He is generally anxious, if only for diplomatic reasons,
to find American music that is worth singing or playing. Even
when he fails to find any that is worth performing, he often
performs some that isn’t, in order to satisfy local pride. Moreover,
Americans are no more prejudiced against American musicians
than they are against other kinds. As a matter of fact,
if intensive boosting campaigns produced creative artists, the
American composer during the past decade should have expanded
like a hot-house strawberry. We have had prize contests
of all kinds, offering substantial sums for everything from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
grand operas to string quartettes, we have had societies formed
to publish his chamber-music scores; publishers have rushed to
print his smaller works; we have had concerts of American
compositions; we have had all-American festivals. Meanwhile
the American composer has, with a few lonely exceptions, obstinately
refused to produce anything above the level of what
it would be flattering to call mediocrity.</p>

<p>No. If he is not heard oftener in concert halls and upon recital
platforms, it is because he is not good enough. There is,
in the music of even the second-rate Continental composers, a
surety of touch, a quality of evident confidence in their material
and ease in its handling that is rarely present in the work
of Americans. Most American symphonic and chamber music
lacks structure and clarity. The workmanship is faulty, the
utterance stammers and halts. Listening to an average American
symphonic poem, you get the impression that the composer
was so amazed and delighted at being able to write a
symphonic poem at all that the fact that it might be a dull
one seemed of minor importance to him. When he isn’t
being almost entirely formless he is generally safely conventional,
preferring to stick to what a statesman would call the
Ways of the Fathers rather than risk some structural innovation
what might or might not be effective. Tschaikovsky’s
variation of the traditional sequence of movements in the
<cite>Pathétique</cite> symphony, for example—ending with the slow
movement instead of the march—would scandalize and terrify
the average American.</p>

<p>This feebleness and uncertainty in the handling of material
makes American music sound more sterile and commonplace
than it really is. The American composer never seems certain
just what, if anything, he wants to say. His themes, his fundamental
ideas, are often of real significance, but he has no
control over that very essence of the language of music, mood.
He lacks taste. The fact that an American composition may
begin in a genuinely impressive mood is no guarantee at all that
inside of twenty-four bars it may not fall into the most appalling
banalities. We start with lyric beauty and finish in
stickiness. The curse of bathos is upon us. We lack staying
power. Just as so many American dramatists can write two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
good acts of a three-act play, so many American novelists can
write superb opening chapters, so do American composers devise
eloquent opening themes. But we all fail when it comes
to development. The train is laid, the match is applied, and
the spectators crowd back in delighted terror amid tremendous
hissings and sputterings. But when the awaited detonation
comes, it is too often only a pop.</p>

<p>Such failure to make adequate use of his ideas is partially
attributable to the American musician’s pathetically inadequate
technical equipment. Generally speaking, he doesn’t know
his business. He has been unable, or hasn’t bothered, to learn
his trade. Imagine if you can a successful dramatist who can
neither read nor write, but has to dictate his plays, or a painter
who can only draw the outlines of his pictures, hiring some one
else to lay in the colours, and you have something analogous to
many an American “composer” whose music is taken seriously
by Americans, and who cannot write out a playable piano part,
arrange a song for choral performance, or transcribe a hymn
tune for a string quartette. Such elementary work he has to
have done for him, whenever it is necessary, by some hack.
This, to say nothing of the more advanced branches of musical
science, like counterpoint, fugue, orchestration. Though it is
risky to generalize, it is probably safe to say that among Americans
who write music, the man who can construct a respectable
fugue or canon or score a piece for full orchestra is decidedly
the exception. In Europe, of course, any man who did not
have these technical resources at his fingertips would have to
be a Moussorgsky to be taken seriously as a composer at all.</p>

<p>It is not entirely the American’s fault that he is so ill-equipped.
Much of his comparative musical illiteracy, true,
is the result of his own laziness and his traditional American
contempt for theory and passion for results. On the other
hand, the young American who honestly desires a good theoretical
training in music must either undertake the expensive
adventure of journeying to one of the few cities that contain
a first-class conservatory, or the equally expensive one of going
to Europe. If he can do neither, he must to a great extent
educate himself. Some kinds of training it is nearly impossible
for him to obtain here at any price. Orchestration, for instance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
a tremendously complex and difficult science, can be
mastered only by the time-honoured trial and error method,
i.e., by writing out scores and hearing them played. How is
our young American to manage this? Granted that there is
a symphony orchestra near him, how can he get his scores
played? The conductor cannot be blamed for refusing. He
is hired to play the works of masters, not to try out the apprentice
efforts of unskilled aspirants. What we need so badly
here are not more first-class orchestras, but more second-rate
ones, small-town orchestras that could afford to give the tyro
a chance.</p>

<p>Because of their lack of technical skill many composers in
this country never venture into the broader fields of composition
at all. As a class, we write short piano and violin pieces,
or songs. We write them because we do earnestly desire to
write something and because they do not demand the technical
resourcefulness and sustained inspiration that we lack. Parenthetically,
I don’t for a moment mean to imply that clumsy
workmanship and sterility are unknown in Europe, that we are
all mediocrities and they are all <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Uebermenschen</i>. As a matter
of fact, we have to-day probably much more creative musical
talent, if less brains, than Europe; but, talent for talent, the
European is infinitely better trained. This, at least in part,
because he respects theory and has a desire for technical proficiency
that we almost totally lack. Then too, the European
has some cultural background. There is a curious lack of inter-communication
among the arts in this country. The painter
seems to feel that literature has nothing direct to give him, the
writer, that music and painting are not in his line, and the musician—decidedly
the worst of the three in this respect—that
his own art has no connection with anything.</p>

<p>The American composer’s most complete failure is intellectual.
The fact that he writes music seldom warrants the assumption
that he has the artist’s point of view at all. He is
likely to be a much less interesting person than one’s iceman.
Ten to one, he never visits a picture gallery or a sculpture exhibition,
his taste in the theatre is probably that of the tired
business man, and what little reading he does is likely to be
confined to trade papers, <cite>Snappy Stories</cite>, and best-sellers. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
takes no interest in politics, economics, or sociology, either national
or international (how could they possibly concern him?),
and probably cannot discuss even music with pleasure or profit
to anybody.</p>

<p>The natural inference that might be drawn from this diatribe—that
the composing of music in this country is confined exclusively
to the idiot classes—is not strictly true. Plenty of
American musicians are intelligent and cultured men as well;
but that is not America’s fault. She is just as cordial to the
stupid ones. And the widespread impotence and technical
sloppiness of American music is the inevitable result of the
American attitude toward music and to the anomalous position
the art occupies in this country.</p>

<p>Let me be platitudinous in the interest of clarity and point
out what we so often forget: that our nation, unlike most of
the others, is not a race as well. We have common wellsprings
of thought, but—and this is significant and ominous—none of
feeling. Sheer environment may teach people to think alike
within a generation; but it takes centuries of common emotional
experiences to make them feel alike. Any average American,
even of the National-Security-League-one-hundred-per-centum
variety, may have in his veins the blood of English,
French, Italian, and Russian ancestors, and there is no saying
that his emotional nature is going to find many heart-beats in
common with some equally average neighbour, whose ancestry
may be, say, Irish, Danish, and Hungarian. What national
spirit we have has been determined, first, by the fact that the
ancestors of every one of us, whether they came here twenty
years ago or two hundred, were pioneers. Every one of them
left a civilization whose cultural background had been established
for centuries, to come to a land where the problem of
mere existence was of prime importance. Again, many of them
were religious fanatics. In the life of the pioneer there was
little room for art of any sort, and least for music. What he
demanded of music, when he had time to spare for it, was that
above all things it distract him from the fatigue and worry of
everyday life, either by amusing him or by furnishing a sentimental
reminder of old ways. To the Puritan, music, both for
its own sake and as entertainment, was anathema. As sensuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
beauty it was popish, and as entertainment it was worldly
pleasure, and therefore wicked. To be tolerated at all, it must
be practical, i.e., perform some moral service by being a hymn
tune. And what the American pioneer and the American Puritan
asked a few generations back, the average American asks
to-day whenever he is confronted with any work of art: Does
it point a moral? If not, will it help me to kill time without
boring me?</p>

<p>Instruction, release, or amusement: that, in general, is all
we want of art. The American’s favourite picture is one that
tells a story, or shows the features of some famous person, or
the topography of some historic spot. Fantastic pictures he
likes, because they show him people and places far removed
from his own rather tedious environment, but they must be a
gaudy, literal, solid sort of fantasy—Maxfield Parrish rather
than Aubrey Beardsley. If he can’t have these, he wants
pretty girls or comics. Purely decorative or frankly meaningless
pictures—Hokusai and Whistler (except, of course, the
portraits of Carlyle and his mother)—do not exist for him.
Sculpture—which he does not understand—is probably his favourite
art-form, for it is tangible, three-dimensionable, stable.
He doesn’t mind poetry, for it, too, gives him release. He likes
novels, especially “glad” ones or mystery stories. He even
tolerates realism if, as in “Main Street,” it gives him release
by showing him a set of consistently contemptible and uncultured
characters to whom even he must feel superior. His
architecture he likes either ornate to imbecility or utilitarian
to hideousness.</p>

<p>In other words, the typical American goes to an art-work
either frankly to have his senses tickled or for the sake of a
definite thing that it says or a series of extraneous images or
thoughts that it evokes—never for the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ding an sich</i>. Of pure
æsthetic emotion he exhibits very little. To him, beauty is
emphatically not its own excuse for being. He does not want
it for its own sake, and distrusts and fears it when it appears
before him unclothed in moral lessons or associated ideas. In
such a civilization music can occupy but a very unimportant
place. For music is, morally or intellectually, the most meaningless
of arts: it teaches no lesson, it offers no definite escape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
from life to the literal-minded, and aside from the primitive
and obvious associations of patriotic airs and “mother” songs,
it evokes no associated images or ideas. To love music you
must be willing to enjoy beauty pretty largely for its own sake,
without asking it to mean anything definite in words or pictures.
This the American hates to do. Since he cannot be edified,
he refuses to be stirred. There is nothing left for him,
therefore, in music, except such enjoyment as he can get out
of a pretty tune or an infectious rhythm.</p>

<p>And that, despite our admirable symphony orchestras and
our two superb permanent opera companies (all run at a loss,
by the way), is about all that music means to the average
American—amusement. He simply does not see how an art
that doesn’t teach him anything, that is a shameless assault
upon his emotions (he makes no distinction between emotions
and senses), can possibly play any significant part in his life.
So, as a nation, he does what he generally does in other matters
of art, delegates its serious cultivation to women.</p>

<p>Women constitute ninety per cent. of those who support
music in this country. It is women who attend song and instrumental
recitals; it is women who force reluctant husbands
and fathers to subscribe for opera seats and symphony concerts;
the National Federation of Musical Clubs, which works
throughout the country to foster the appreciation of music, is
composed entirely of women; at least two-thirds of the choral
organizations in the United States contain women’s voices only.
It is no disparagement of their activities to say that such a
state of affairs is unhealthy. This well-nigh complete feminization
of music is bad for it. After all, art, to be alive, must
like any other living thing be the result of collaboration.
Women have undertaken to be the moral guardians of the race,
and no one can deny that they guard, upon the whole, as well
as men could; but their guardianship is a bit too zealous at
times, and their predominance in our musical life aggravates
our already exaggerated tendency to demand that art be edifying.
One of the conditions of the opera contest conducted
by the National Federation in 1914 was that the libretto must
contain nothing immoral or suggestive (I paraphrase). Now
music is, after all, an adult occupation, and it might be assumed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
that a composer competent to write an opera score might have
taste and intelligence enough not to be vulgar—for, surely, vulgarity
was all they wanted to guard against. If the clause
were to be interpreted literally, it would bar the librettos of
<cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Tristan</cite>, <cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Walküre</cite>, <cite>Carmen</cite>, <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pelléas et Mélisande</cite>, and <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">L’Amore
dei Tre Re</cite>—a supposition quite too unthinkable. The feminine
influence helps to increase the insularity of our musicians.
Women are more chauvinistic in art matters—if possible—than
men, and among the women’s clubs that are trying to encourage
the American composer there is a tendency to insist rather
that he be American than that he be a composer. Since it is
women who support our recitals and concerts it is they who
must assume responsibility for our excessive cult of the performer.
This land is certainly the happy hunting-ground of the
virtuoso, be he singer, player, or conductor. What he chooses to
sing, play, or conduct is comparatively unimportant to us. Our
audiences seem to gather not so much to listen as to look; or if
they do listen, it is to the voice or the instrument rather than
to the music. The announcement, “Farrar in <em>Carmen</em>” will
pack the Metropolitan to the doors; but if the bill be changed,
and <em>Zaza</em> be substituted at the last moment, who cares?
Indeed the ticket agencies, knowing what people really attend
opera for, frankly advertise “tickets for Farrar to-night.”
Rachmaninoff is a great pianist, and Rachmaninoff playing an
all-Chopin programme could fill Carnegie Hall at any time.
But Rachmaninoff playing a programme of Czerny’s “Exercises
for the Beginner” could fill it just as well. Announce an
all-Chopin programme without naming the pianist, and see how
much of an audience you draw. The people who go to hear
Galli-Curci sing the shadow-song from <cite>Dinora</cite> do not go to hear
music at all. They go as they would go to see Bird Millman
walk a slack wire; they go to hear a woman prove that, given
a phenomenal development of the vocal cords, she can, after
years of practice, perform scales and trills <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">in altissimo</i> very
nearly as well as the union flute-player who furnishes her obligato.
All this is to a certain extent true elsewhere, of course.
It is natural that if one person can sing or play better than
another, audiences should prefer to hear him rather than another.
But this worship of the performance rather than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
thing performed, this blind adoration of skill for its own sake,
is cultivated in America to a degree that is quite unparalleled.</p>

<p>Many American cities and large towns hold annual musical
festivals, lasting from two days to a week or more, and these
are often mentioned as evidence of the existence of a genuine
musical culture among us. Are they? What happens at them?
For one thing, the local choral society performs a cantata or
oratorio. This is more than likely to be either <cite>The Messiah</cite> or
<cite>Elijah</cite>, works which through long association have taken on
less the character of musical compositions than of devotional
exercises. Edification again. Soloists are engaged, as expensive
and famous as the local budget allows, and these give recitals
during the remaining sessions of the festival. The
audiences come largely to see these marvels rather than to
hear music, for after the annual spree of culture is over they
return home contentedly enough to another year void of any
music whatever. Hearing a little music is better than hearing
none, but the test of genuine culture is whether or not it is an
integral part of life rather than a vacation from it. By this
test the annual festival would seem to exert about as much permanent
cultural influence as a clambake.</p>

<p>The total unconsciousness on the part of his fellow-countrymen
that art is related to life, a sense of futility and unreality,
is what makes the lot of the musician in America a hard one,
and is responsible for his failure as an artist. If people get
the kind of government they deserve, they most certainly get
the kind of art they demand; and if, comparatively speaking,
there is no American composer, it is because America doesn’t
want him, doesn’t see where he fits in.</p>

<p>Suppose most American music is trivial and superficial?
How many Americans would know the difference if it were
profound? The composer here lives in an atmosphere that is,
at the worst, good-natured contempt. Contempt, mind you,
not for himself—that wouldn’t matter—but for his very art.
In the minds of many of his compatriots it ranks only as an
entertainment and a diversion, slightly above embroidery and
unthinkably below baseball. At best, what he gets is unintelligent
admiration, not as an artist, but as a freak. Blind Tom,
the negro pianist, is still a remembered and admired figure in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
American musical history; and Blind Tom was an idiot. To
an American, the process of musical composition is a mysterious
and incomprehensible trick—like sword-swallowing or
levitation—and as such he admires it; but he does not respect
it. He cannot understand how any normal he-man can spend
his life thinking up tunes and putting them down on paper.
Tunes are pleasant things, of course, especially when they
make your feet go or take you back to the days when you went
straw-riding; but as for taking them seriously, and calling it
work—man’s work—to think them up ... any one who
thinks that can be dismissed as a crank.</p>

<p>If the crank could make money, it might be different.
The respect accorded to artists in our country is pretty sharply
graded in accordance with their earning power. Novelists and
playwrights come first, since literature and the stage are known
to furnish a “good living.” Sculptors have a certain standing,
on account of the rumoured prices paid for statues and public
memorials, though scenario writers are beginning to rank
higher. Painters are eyed with a certain suspicion, though
there is always the comfortable belief that the painter probably
pursues a prosperous career of advertising art on the side.
But poets and composers are decidedly men not to be taken
seriously. This system of evaluation is not quite as crass as
it sounds. America has so long been the land of opportunity,
we have so long gloried in her supremacy as the place to make
a living, that we have an instinctive conviction that if a man
is really doing a good job he must inevitably make money at
it. Only, poetry and music have the bad luck to be arts wherein
a man may be both great and successful and still be unable
to look the landlord in the eye. Since such trades are so
unprofitable, we argue, those who pursue them are presumably
incompetent. The one class of composer whom the American
does take seriously is the writer of musical comedy and popular
songs, not only because he can make money, but because
he provides honest, understandable entertainment for man and
beast. That, perhaps, is why our light music is the best of its
kind in the world.</p>

<p>The self-styled music-lover in this country too often brings
little more genuine comprehension to music. He is likely to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
a highbrow (defined as a person educated beyond his intelligence),
with all the mental obtuseness and snobbishness of his
class. He divides music into “popular”—meaning light—and
“classical”—meaning pretentious. Now there is good
music and bad, and the composer’s pretensions have little to do
with the case. Compare, for example, the first-act finale of
Victor Herbert’s <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mlle. Modiste</cite> with such vulgar rubbish as
<cite xml:lang="it" lang="it">Donna è mobile</cite>. Yet because the latter is sung by tenors,
at the Metropolitan, the highbrow solemnly catalogues it as
“classical,” abolishing the work of Herbert, Berlin, and Kern,
three greatly gifted men, with the adjective “popular.” In
general, he is the faithful guardian of the Puritan tradition,
always sniffing the air for a definite “message” or moral, seeking
sermons in tones, books in running arpeggios. It never
occurs to him that just as words are the language of intellect,
so is music the language of emotion, that its whole excuse for
existence is its perfection in saying what lies just beyond and
above words, and that if you can reduce a composer’s message
to words, you automatically render it meaningless.</p>

<p>Music criticism in America is amazingly good in the cities.
The system under which the critics must work, however,
whereby they are supposed to “cover” everything (in New
York this theoretically entails making some sort of critical
comment upon every one of three or four hundred events in a
single season) is so impossible that much of their work is inevitably
scamped and perfunctory. Elsewhere throughout the
country criticism is handed over to reporters, who generally
avoid trouble by approving of everything. There is a tendency
toward the double standard—holding the stranger strictly to
account, especially the foreigner, and being “nice” to the
native—that produces demoralizing results.</p>

<p>Of real musical journalism we have none. There is <cite>The
Musical Quarterly</cite>, good of its kind, but rather ponderous and
making no pretence to timeliness. The monthlies are chiefly
for the teacher. The weeklies are in general frankly “shop”
organs, devoted to the activities of the performer and filled
with his advertisements, portraits, and press notices. There
is no medium for the exchange of contemporary thought, for
the discussion of topics having a non-professional cultural interest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
Music publishing here is an industry, conducted like
any other industry. The Continental type of publisher, who
is a scholar and a musician, and a gentleman who is conscious
of a duty to music as well as to the stockholders, is almost
unknown here. To our publishers music is a commodity, to
be bought cheap and sold dear, and most of them will publish
anything that looks profitable, regardless of its quality. Their
typographical standards are higher than those anywhere in the
world, except Germany.</p>

<p>So the American composer in America works more or less in
a vacuum. He is out of things, and he knows it. If he attempts
to say something, through his art, that will be intelligible
to his countrymen, he is baffled by the realization that
his countrymen don’t understand his language. This particular
difficulty, this sense of inarticulateness, probably weighed
less heavily upon the last two generations of American composers;
for they were, most of them, virtually German composers.
In their time a thorough technical education in music
was so nearly unobtainable here that it was simpler to go
abroad for it. So, from Paine to MacDowell, they went to
Germany. There they learned their trade, and at least learned
it thoroughly; but they learned to write, not only music, but
German music. To them, German music was music. Their
songs were <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Lieder</i>; their symphonies and overtures were little
sinister sons of Beethoven, Raff, and Brahms. So completely
Teutonized did our musical speech become that we still find
it hard to believe that French music, Spanish music, Russian
music is anything but an imperfect translation from the German.
A few went to Paris and learned to write with a French
accent. MacDowell was, and remains, our best: a first-rank
composer, who died before his work was done. His earlier
music was all written, performed, and published in Germany,
and it is as <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">echt Deutsch</i> as that of Raff, his master. Not until
he approached middle life did he evolve a musical idiom that
was wholly of MacDowell, the American. Most of the rest
came back to spend their days fashioning good, honest, square-toed
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kapellmeistermusik</i> that had about as much genuine relation
to their America as the Declaration of Independence has
to ours. They might feel this lack of contact, but at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
they had the consolation of knowing that there were people
in the world to whom what they said was at least intelligible.</p>

<p>The American of the present generation has no such consolation.
He has probably not been trained abroad. He wants to
write music, and being human, he wants it understood. But
the minute he tries to express himself he betrays the fact that
he does not know what he wants to express. Any significant
work of art is inevitably based on the artist’s relation and reaction
to life. But the American composer’s relation to the
common life is unreal. His activities strike his fellows as unimportant
and slightly irrational. He can’t lay his finger upon
the great, throbbing, common pulse of America because for
him there is none. So he tries this, that, and the other, hoping
by luck to stumble upon the thing he wants to say. He tries
desperately to be American. Knowing that the great national
schools of music in other countries are based upon folksong, he
tries to find the American folksong, so as to base his music
upon that. He utilizes Negro tunes, and when they fail to
strike the common chord he devises themes based upon Indian
melodies. What he fails to see is that the folksongs of Europe
express the common <em>racial</em> emotions of a nation, not its geographical
accidents. When a Frenchman hears <em>Malbrouck</em> he
is moved by what moved generations of long-dead Frenchmen;
when a Russian hears <em>Dubinushka</em> he is stirred by what has
stirred Russians for centuries. But even if some melody did
stir the pulse of Geronimo, the mere fact that he was a former
resident of my country is no proof that it is going to stir
mine. If you insist that Negro music is the proper basis for
an American school of composition, try telling a Southerner
that when he hears <cite>Swing Low, Sweet Chariot</cite>, he is hearkening
to the voices of his ancestors!</p>

<p>A curious symptom of this feeling of disinheritance is the
tendency of so many Americans to write what might be called
the music of escape, music that far from attempting to affirm
the composer’s relation to his day and age is a deliberate attempt
to liberate himself by evoking alien and exotic moods
and atmosphere. The publishers’ catalogues are full of Arab
meditations, Persian dances, Hindu serenades, and countless
similar attempts to get “anywhere out of the world.” The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
best work of Charles Griffes, whose untimely death last year
robbed us of a true creative talent, was his symphonic poem,
“The Pleasure Dome of Kubla Khan,” and his settings of
Chinese and Japanese lyrics in Oriental rhythms and timbres.
Not that the mere choice of subject is important; it is the actual
mood and idiom of so much of this music that is significant
evidence of the impulse to give up and forget America,
to create a dream-world wherein one can find refuge from the
land of chewing gum and victrolas.</p>

<p>These same victrolas, by the way, with their cousin, the
player-piano, which so outrage the sensibilities of many a musician
of the elder day, are a very real force in helping to
civilize this country musically. The American is by no means
as unmusical as he thinks he is. His indifference to art is only
the result of his purely industrial civilization, and his tendency
to mix morals with æsthetics is a habit of thought engendered
by his ancestry. The Puritan tradition makes him fearful
and suspicious of any sort of sensuous or emotional response,
but it has not rendered him incapable of it. Catch him off his
guard, get him away from the fear of being bored, and he is
far from insensitive to music. He buys victrola records because
he is a hero-worshipper, because he wants to hear the
expensive Caruso and Kreisler and McCormack; but inevitably
he is bound to take some notice of what they play and sing,
and to recognize it when he hears it again. In spite of himself
he begins to acquire a rudimentary sort of musical background.
He begins by buying jazz rolls for his player-piano,
and is likely in the long run, if only out of curiosity, to progress
from “blues” to Chopin, via Moszkovski and Grainger.</p>

<p>But the greatest present-day force for good, musically, in this
country, is the large motion-picture house. Music has always
been a necessary accompaniment to motion pictures, in order
to compensate for the uncanny silence in which these photographic
wraiths unfold their dramas. Starting with a modest
ensemble of piano and glass crash, the motion-picture orchestra
has gradually increased in size and quality, the pipe organ has
been introduced to augment and alternate it, so that the larger
houses to-day can boast a musical equipment that is amazingly
good. A few years ago S. L. Rothafel devised a glorified type<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
of entertainment that was a sort of combination picture-show
and “pop” concert. He built a theatre, the Rialto, especially
to house it, containing a stage that was little more than a picture
frame, a large pipe organ, and an orchestra platform large
enough to hold seventy or eighty players. He recruited a permanent
orchestra large enough to play symphonic works, and
put Hugo Riesenfeld, an excellent violinist and conductor, who
had been trained under Arthur Nikisch, in charge of the performances.
These, besides the usual film presentations, comprised
vocal and instrumental solos and detached numbers by
the orchestra. All the music played at these entertainments
was good—in what is known in this country as “classical.”
Riesenfeld devised a running accompaniment to the films, assembled
from the best orchestral music obtainable—a sort of
synthetic symphonic poem that fitted the mood and action of
the film presented, and was, of course, much too good for it.</p>

<p>This new entertainment form was instantly successful, and
is rapidly becoming the standard offering at all the larger picture
houses. It is a significant step in our musical life, for it is
the first entirely successful attempt in this country to adapt
art to popular wants. At last the average man is going of
his own accord into a public hall and hearing music—real music—and
discovering that he likes it. The picture house allows
him to pretend that he is going solely to see the films, and
needn’t listen unless he wants to. He finds that “classical”
music is not nearly so boresome as many of its admirers.
Freed from the highbrow’s condescension, unconscious of uplift,
he listens and responds to music like the prelude to <cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Tristan</cite>,
the <cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Walkürenritt</cite>, the <cite>New World</cite> symphony, Tschaikovsky’s
<cite>Fourth</cite>, and the <cite>Eroica</cite>. Theodore Thomas rendered no
more valuable service to music in America than have Samuel
Rothafel and Hugo Riesenfeld.</p>

<p>We are still far from utopia, however. In one of his essays
upon communal art Henry Caro-Delvaille speaks of “the true
Mediterranean <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit</i>, the viable art philosophy of the French
race, which is essentially plastic, accepting and delineating life,
free alike from dogmatism and mysticism.” Try to frame a
sentence like that about America. Try to make any generalization
about the American spirit without using “liberty,” “free<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
institutions,” “resourcefulness,” “opportunity,” or other politico-economic
terms, if you would know what confronts the
American artist, above all the American musician, when he
attempts to become articulate to his countrymen. We simply
have no common æsthetic emotions. No wonder our music
flounders and stammers, and trails off into incoherence!</p>

<p>Wagner wrote <cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Die Meistersinger</cite> in a deliberate effort to
express the German artistic creed; Verdi wrote consciously as
an Italian; Glinka founded an entire school of composers whose
sole aim was to express Russia. Such a task is beyond the
American. The others were spokesmen for a race: he has
no race to speak for, and the moment he pretends that he has,
and tries to speak for it, he becomes conscious and futile. To
speak of American music, in any ethnic sense, is naïve; you
might as well speak of Baptist music. No. The American
must accept his lot. There is but one audience he can write
for, and that is himself. John Smith, American composer,
dare not say: “I write to express America.” He can only
say: “I write to express John Smith. I accept my life because,
after all, it is mine, and I interpret my life because it
is the only life I know.” And because John Smith is an
American, and because somewhere, remote and inarticulate,
there must be an American soul, then perhaps, if he does
honest work and is true to himself, he may succeed in saying
something that is of America, and of nowhere else, and that
other Americans will hear and understand.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="POETRY">POETRY</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">There</span> are many fashions, among contemporary critics,
of regarding American poetry, each of them perhaps of
equal helpfulness, since each is one facet of an imaginable
whole. There is the view of Mr. John Middleton Murry,
an English critic, that it depends perhaps a shade too much
on narrative or dramatic interest, on bizarrerie (if I may very
freely elaborate his notion) or, in general, on a kind of sensationalism,
a use of superficially intriguing elements which are
not specifically the right—or at all events the best—elements
of poetry. There is the view of Mr. Louis Untermeyer, one of
the ablest of our own critics and also one of the most versatile
of our parodists and poets, that our contemporary poetry is
good in measure as it comes in the direct line from Whitman:
good, that is to say, when it is the voice of the poet who accepts,
accepts joyously and largely, even loosely, this new
world environment, these new customs, social and industrial,
above all, it may be, the new sense of freedom which he might,
if pressed, trace back to Karl Marx on one hand and Sigmund
Freud on the other. There is again the view of Miss Amy
Lowell that our poetry is good, or tends to be, precisely in
proportion as it represents an outgrowing, by the poet, of his
acute awareness of a social or ethical “here and now,” and the
attainment of a relatively pure pre-occupation with beauty—the
sense of freedom here exercising itself principally, if not
altogether, with regard to literary tradition, especially the English:
once more, I dilate the view to make it the more broadly
representative. And there is, finally, the view of the conservative,
by no means silent even in this era, that what is good
in contemporary American poetry is what is for the moment
least conspicuous—the traditional, seen as it appears inevitably
in America to be seen, as something graceful, sentimental,
rightly ethical, gently idealistic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<p>What will be fairly obvious is that if we follow a little way
any particular one of these critics, we shall find him attempting
to urge our poetry in a particular direction, a direction
which he prefers to any other direction, and analysing its
origins in such a way, if he analyses at all, as to make plausible
its (postulated) growth in that direction. This is the natural,
even perhaps the best thing, for a participant critic to do—it
contributes, certainly, an interest and an energy. But if in
some freak of disinterestedness, we wish if for only a moment
to see American poetry with no concern save that of inordinate
and intelligent curiosity, then it is to all of these views that
we must turn, rather than to any one, and to the obverse of
each, as well as to the face. For if one thing is apparent to-day
in a study of American letters, it is that we must heroically
resist any temptation to simplify, to look in only one direction
for origins or in only one direction for growth. Despite our
national motto, American civilization is not so much one in
many as many in one. We have not, as England has and as
France has, a single literary heart; our literary capitals and
countries are many, each with its own vigorous people, its own
self-interest, its own virtues and provincialisms. We may attribute
this to the mere matter of our size, and the consequent
geographical sequestration of this or that group—that is
no doubt a factor, but of equal importance is the fact that
in a new country, of rapid and chaotic material growth,
we must inevitably have, according to the locality, marked
variations in the rapidity of growth of the vague thing we call
civilization. Chicago is younger than Boston, older than San
Francisco. And what applies to the large unit applies also
to the small—if the country in general has not yet reached
anything remotely like a cultural homogeneity (as far, that is,
as we ever in viewing a great nation expect such a thing) neither
has any section of it, nor any city of it. It is no longer possible,
if indeed it ever was, to regard a section like New England,
for example, as a definite environmental factor, say “y,”
and to conclude, as some critics are so fond of doing, that any
poet who matures there will inevitably be representable as
“yp.” This is among the commonest and falsest of false
simplifications. Our critics, frantically determined to find an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
American poetry that is autochthonous, will see rocky pastures,
mountains and birches in the poetry of a New Englander,
or skyscrapers in the poetry of a New Yorker, or stockyards
in the poetry of a Chicagoan, as easily as a conjurer takes
a rabbit from a hat.</p>

<p>What refuge we have from a critical basis so naïve is in
assuming from the outset, toward contemporary American
poetry, an attitude guardedly pluralistic—we begin by observing
merely that American poetry is certainly, at the moment,
if quantitative production and public interest are any measure,
extraordinarily healthy and vigorous. We are accustomed to
hearing it called a renaissance. The term is admissible if we
carefully exclude, in using it, any implication of a revival of
classicism. What we mean by it is simply that the moment is
one of quite remarkable energy, productiveness, range, colour,
and anarchy. What we do not mean by it is that we can trace
with accuracy where this outburst comes from. The origins of
the thing are obscure. It was audible in 1914—Mr. Edwin
Arlington Robinson and Mr. Ezra Pound were audible before
that; it burst into full chorus in 1915; and ever since there
has been, with an occasional dying fall, a lusty corybantic
cacophony. Just where this amazing procession started nobody
clearly knows. Mr. Untermeyer would have us believe that
Walt Whitman was, as it were, the organizer of it, Miss Monroe
tries to persuade us that it was <cite>Poetry: a Magazine of
Verse</cite>, But the facts, I think, wave aside either postulate.
If one thing is remarkable it is that in this spate of poetry the
influence of Walt Whitman—an influence, one would suppose,
as toxic for the young as Swinburne—is so inconsiderable: if
another is even more remarkable, it is that in all this chorus
one so seldom hears a voice of which any previous American
voice was the clear prototype. We have had, of course, our
voices—of the sort, I mean, rich enough in character to make
imitation an easy and tempting thing. Longfellow, Lowell,
Bryant, Sill, Lanier are not in this regard considerable,—but
what of Poe, whose influence we have seen in French poetry
on Baudelaire, and in contemporary English poetry on Mr.
Walter de la Mare? No trace of him is discoverable, unless
perhaps we find the ghostliest of his shadows now and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
across the work of Mr. John Gould Fletcher, or Mr. Maxwell
Bodenheim, or Mr. Wallace Stevens, a shadow cast, in all
these cases, amid much else, from a technical and colouristic
standpoint, which would have filled Poe with alarm. And
there is another American poet, perhaps as great as Poe, perhaps
greater (as he in turn is perhaps greater than Whitman—as
poet, though not as personality)—Emily Dickinson. Of
that quietist and mystic, who walked with tranquillity midway
between Blake and Emerson, making of her wilful imperfections
a kind of perfectionism, why do we hear so little?
Do we catch now and again the fleetingest glimpse of her in
the early work of Mr. Robert Frost? If so, it is certainly
nowhere else. Yet it would be hard to prove that she has no
right to a place with Poe and Whitman, or indeed among the
best poets in the language.</p>

<p>But nowhere in America can we find, for contemporary
poetry, any clear precursive signal. Little as it may comfort
our fuglemen of the autochthonous, we must, I think, look to
Europe for its origins. This is not, as some imagine, a disgrace—it
would be a melancholy thing, of course, if we merely
imitated the European, without alteration. But Browning
would hardly recognize himself, even if he cared to, in the
“Domesday Book” of Mr. Edgar Lee Masters, Mallarmé and
Rimbaud would find Mr. Fletcher a mirror with an odd trick
of distortion, Laforgue would have to look twice at Mr. T. S.
Eliot’s “Prufrock” (for all its Hamletism), M. Paul Fort
would scarcely feel at home in Miss Amy Lowell’s “Can
Grande’s Castle,” Mr. Thomas Hardy and the ghost of Tennyson
would not quarrel much for the possession of Mr. Robinson’s
work, nor Mr. Chesterton and the author of “The
Ingoldsby Legends” for the lively sonorities of Mr. Vachel
Lindsay. In such cases we have not so much “influence” as
fertilization. It is something of Mr. Masters that “The Ring
and the Book” reveals to Mr. Masters: something of Miss
Lowell to which M. Paul Fort offers her the key. Was it a
calamity for Baudelaire that he lived only by a transfusion of
blood from an American? Is Becquer the less Becquer or
Spanish for having fed upon the “Buch der Lieder”?...
Culture is bartered, nowadays, at open frontiers, and if to-day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
a new theme, chord, or colour-scheme is French, German, or
American, to-morrow it is international.</p>

<p>If we differ in this respect from any other country it is only
that we are freer to exploit, really exhaust, the new, because
we hold, less than any other, to any classical traditions: for
traditions our poets seldom look back further than the 19th
century. We have the courage, often indistinguishable from
folly, of our lack of convictions. Thus it comes about that as
America is the melting-pot for races, so she is in a fair way
to become a melting-pot for cultures: we have the energy, the
curiosity, the intelligence, above all the lack of affiliations with
the past, which admirably adapt us to a task—so precisely
demanding complete self-surrender—of æsthetic experiment.
Ignorance has some compensations—I mean, of course, a partial
ignorance. If Mr. Lindsay had been brought up exclusively
on Aristotle, Plato, Æschylus, and Euripides, and had
been taken out of the shadow of the church by Voltaire and
Darwin, perhaps he would not have been so “free” to experiment
with the “higher vaudeville.” It will be observed that
this is an odd kind of “freedom,” for it amounts in some ways
to little more than the “freedom” of the prison. For if too
severe a training in the classics unfits one somewhat for bold
experiment, too little of it is as likely, on the other hand, to
leave one with an æsthetic perceptiveness, a sensibility, in
short, relatively rudimentary.</p>

<p>This, then, is something of the cultural <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mise en scène</i> for our
contemporary poetry. We have repeated waves of European
suggestion breaking Westward over our continent, foaming
rather more in Chicago than in New York; and we have our
lusty young company of swimmers, confident that they are
strong enough to ride these waves farther than any one in
Europe rode them and with a more native grace. What is
most conspicuously American in most of these swimmers is
the fact that they rely not so much on skill and long training
as on sheer energy, vitality, and confidence. They rely, indeed,
in most cases, on a kind of exuberance or superabundance.
Do we not feel this in the work of Mr. Edgar Lee
Masters—does he not try, in these many full books of his,
where the good is so inextricably enmeshed with the bad, simply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
to beat us down as under a cataract? “Domesday Book”
is, rather, an avalanche. He never knows what to exclude,
where to stop. Miss Lowell, Mr. Fletcher, Mr. Carl Sandburg,
and Mr. Lindsay are not far behind him, either—they
are all copious. I do not mean to imply that this is a bad
thing, at the moment—at the moment I am not sure that this
sheer exuberance is not, for us, the very <em>best</em> thing. Energy
is the first requisite of a “renaissance,” and supplies its material,
or, in another light, its richness of colour. Not the beginning,
but the end, of a renaissance is in refinement; and
I think we are certainly within bounds in postulating that the
last five years have given us at the least a superb beginning,
and enough more than that, perhaps, to make one wonder
whether we have not already cast Poe and Whitman, Sidney
Lanier, and Emily Dickinson, our strange little quartette, into
a shadow.</p>

<p>All that our wonder can hope for is at best a very speculative
answer. If parallels were not so dangerous, we might
look with encouragement at that spangled rhetorical torrent
which we call Elizabethan literature. Ben Jonson did not consider
Shakespeare much of an artist, nor did Milton, and classicists
ever since have followed them in that opinion. If one
can be the greatest of poets and yet not much of an artist, we
may here keep clear of the quarrel: what we get at is the fact
that Shakespeare and the other Elizabethans participated in a
literary movement which, like ours, began in energy, violence,
and extravagance, was at its best excessively rhetorical and
given to unpruned copiousness, and perished as it refined.
Will a future generation see us in a somewhat similar light—will
it like us for our vitality, for the reckless adventurousness
of our literature, our extravagances, and forgive us, if it does
not precisely enjoy as something with a foreign flavour, our
artistic innocence? That is conceivable, certainly. Yet the
view <em>is</em> speculative and we dare not take it too seriously. For
if we have kept hopefully and intelligently abreast of the
contemporary we have kept, none the less, our own very sufficient
aloofness, our own tactilism and awareness, in the light
of which we are bound to have our own scepticisms and self-distrust.
I do not mean that we would perhaps prefer something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
more classical or severe than “Spoon River Anthology”
or “The Congo” or the colour symphonies of Mr. Fletcher,
merely on the ground that it is the intrinsically classical and
severe which we most desire. What we seem to see in contemporary
American poetry is a transition from the more to
the less exuberant, from the less to the more severe; and what
we most <em>desire</em> to see is the attainment of <em>that point</em>, in this
transition, which will give us our parallel to the Shakespearean,
if we may hope for anything even approximately so high; a
point of equipoise.</p>

<p>This hope gives us a convenient vantage from which to
survey the situation, if we also keep in mind our perception of
American cultural heterogeneity and the rashness of any attempt
to generalize about it. The most exact but least diverting
method would be the merely enumerative, the mere roll-call
which would put before us Mr. Edwin Arlington Robinson
and Mr. Ezra Pound as the two of our poets whose public
literary activities extend farthest back, and after them the
group who made themselves known in the interval between
1914 and 1920: Mr. Robert Frost, Mr. Fletcher, Mr. Masters,
Mr. Sandburg, Miss Lowell, Mr. Lindsay, Mr. Alfred Kreymborg,
Mr. Maxwell Bodenheim, Mr. Wallace Stevens, “H. D.,”
Mr. T. S. Eliot, and Miss Sara Teasdale. These poets, with
few exceptions, have little enough in common—nothing, perhaps,
save the fact that they were all a good deal actuated at
the outset by a disgust with the dead level of sentimentality
and prettiness and moralism to which American poetry had
fallen between 1890 and 1910. From that point they diverge
like so many radii. One cannot say, as Miss Lowell has tried
to persuade us, that they have all followed one radius, and
that the differences between them are occasioned by the fact
that some have gone farther than others. We may, for convenience,
classify them, if we do not attach too much importance
to the bounds of our classes. We may say that Mr.
Robinson, Mr. Frost, and Mr. Masters bring back to our
poetry a strong sense of reality; that Mr. Fletcher, Mr. Pound,
Miss Lowell, “H. D.,” and Mr. Bodenheim bring to it a sharpened
consciousness of colour; that Mr. Eliot, Mr. Kreymborg,
and Mr. Stevens bring to it a refinement of psychological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
subtlety; Mr. Sandburg, a grim sense of social responsibility;
Mr. Lindsay, a rhythmic abandon mixed with evangelism; Miss
Teasdale, a grace. The range here indicated is extraordinary.
The existence side by side in one generation and in one country
of such poets as Mr. Masters and Mr. Fletcher, or Mr.
Eliot and Miss Lowell, is anomalous. Clearly we are past
that time when a nation will have at a given moment a single
direct literary current. There is as yet no sign that to any
one of these groups will fall anything like undivided sway.
Mr. Frost’s “North of Boston” and Mr. Fletcher’s “Irradiations”
came out in the same year; “Spoon River Anthology”
and the first “Imagist Anthology”; Mr. Robinson’s “Lancelot”
and Mr. Bodenheim’s “Advice.” And what gulfs even
between members of any one of our arbitrary “classes”! Mr.
Frost’s actualism is seldom far from the dramatic or lyric,
that of Mr. Masters seldom far from the physiological. Mr.
Masters is bitter-minded, tediously explanatory, and his passionate
enquiries fall upon life like so many heavy blows;
his delvings appear morbid as well as searching. Mr. Frost
is gentle, whether in irony, humour, or sense of pain: if it is
the pathos of decay which most moves him, he sees it, none
the less, at dewfall and moonrise, in a dark tree, a birdsong.
The inflections of the human voice, as he hears them, are as
tender as in the hearing of Mr. Masters they are harsh. And
can Mr. Robinson be thought a commensal of either? His
again is a prolonged enquiry into the why of human behaviour,
but how bared of colour, how muffled with reserves and dimmed
with reticence! Here, indeed, is a step toward romanticism.
For Mr. Robinson, though a realist in the sense that his preoccupation
is with motive, turns down the light in the presence
of his protagonist that in the gloom he may take on the air
of something larger and more mysterious than the garishly
actual. Gleams convey the dimensions—hints suggest a depth.
We are not always too precisely aware of what is going on in
this twilight of uncertainties, but Mr. Robinson seems to whisper
that the implications are tremendous. Not least, moreover,
of these implications are the moral—the mirror that Mr.
Robinson holds up to nature gives us back the true, no doubt,
but increasingly in his later work (as in “Merlin” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
“Lancelot,” particularly the latter) with a slight trick of refraction
that makes of the true the exemplary.</p>

<p>We cross a chasm, from these sombre psycho-realists, to the
colourists. To these, one finds, what is human in behaviour or
motive is of importance only in so far as it affords colour or
offers possibilities of pattern. Mr. Fletcher is the most brilliant
of this group, and the most “uncontrolled”: his colourism,
at its best, is a pure, an astonishingly absolute thing. The
“human” element he wisely leaves alone—it baffles and escapes
him. One is aware that this kaleidoscopic whirl of colour
is “wrung out” of Mr. Fletcher, that it conveys what is for
him an intense personal drama, but this does not make his
work “human.” The note of “personal drama” is more complete
in the poetry of “H. D.,” but this too is, in the last analysis,
a nearly pure colourism, as static and fragmentary, however,
as Mr. Fletcher’s is dynamic. Mr. Bodenheim is more
detached, cooler, has a more conscious eye for correspondences
between colour and mood: perhaps we should call him a symbolist.
Even here, however, the “human,” the whim of tenderness,
the psychological gleam, are swerved so that they may fall
into a fantastic design. Miss Lowell, finally, more conscious,
deliberate and energetic than any of these, brilliantly versatile,
utterly detached, while she “sees” more of the objective world
(and has farther-ranging interests), sees it more completely
than any of them simply as raw colour or incipient pattern.
If the literary pulse is here often feverishly high, the empathic
and sympathetic temperature is as often absolute zero.</p>

<p>Mr. Pound shares with Miss Lowell this immersion in the
“literary”—he is intensely aware of the literary past, rifles it
for odds and ends of colour, atmosphere, and attitude, is perpetually
adding bright new bits, from such sources, to his
Joseph’s coat: but if a traditionalist in this, a curio-hunter,
he is an experimentalist in prosody; he has come far from the
sentimental literary affectedness of his early work and at his
best has written lyrics of a singular beauty and transparent
clarity. The psychological factor has from time to time intrigued
him, moreover, and we see him as a kind of link between
the colourists and such poets as Mr. T. S. Eliot, Mr.
Alfred Kreymborg, and Mr. Wallace Stevens. These poets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
are alike in achieving, by a kind of alchemy, the lyric in terms
of the analytic: introspection is made to shine, to the subtly
seen is given a delicate air of false simplicity. Mr. Stevens
is closest to the colourists. His drift has been away from the
analytic and towards the mere capture of a “tone.” Mr.
Kreymborg is a melodist and a mathematician. He takes a
pleasure in making of his poems and plays charming diagrams
of the emotions. Mr. Eliot has more of an eye for the sharp
dramatic gesture, more of an ear for the trenchant dramatic
phrase—he looks now at Laforgue, now at John Webster. His
technical skill is remarkable, his perception of effect is precise,
his range narrow, perhaps increasingly narrow.</p>

<p>Even so rapid and superficial a survey cannot but impress
us with the essential anarchy of this poetic community. Lawlessness
has seemed at times to be the prevailing note; no
poetic principle has remained unchallenged, and we have only
to look in the less prosperous suburbs and corners of this city
to see to what lengths the bolder rebels, whether of the
“Others” group or elsewhere, have gone. Ugliness and shapelessness
have had their adherents among those whom æsthetic
fatigue had rendered momentarily insensitive to the well-shaped;
the fragmentary has had its adherents among those
whom cynicism had rendered incapable of any service, too
prolonged, to one idea. But the fetichists of the ugly and the
fragmentary have exerted, none the less, a wholesome and
fructifying influence. Whatever we feel about the ephemerality
of the specifically ugly or fragmentary, we cannot escape
a feeling that these, almost as importantly as the new realism
or the new colourism, have enlarged what we might term the
general “poetic consciousness” of the time. If there was a
moment when the vogue of the disordered seemed to threaten,
or predict, a widespread and rapid poetic decadence, that moment
is safely past. The tendency is now in the other direction,
and not the least interesting sign is the fact that many
of the former apostles of the disordered are to-day experimenting
with the things they yesterday despised—rhyme, metre,
and the architecture of theme.</p>

<p>We have our affections, in all this, for the fragmentary and
ugly as for the abrupt small hideousness—oddly akin to virility—of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
gargoyles. We have our affections, too, for the rawest
of our very raw realisms—for the maddest of our colourisms,
the most idiosyncratic subtleties of our first introspectionists.
Do we hesitate a little to ask something more of any of the
poets whom we thus designate? What we fear is that in
attempting to give us our something more, they will give us
something less. What we want more of, what we see our
contemporary poets as for the most part sadly deficient in, is
“art.” What we are afraid they will lose, if we urge them in
this direction, is their young sharp brilliance. Urge them,
however, we must. What our poets need most to learn is
that poetry is not merely a matter of outpouring, of confession.
It must be serious: it must be, if simple in appearance, none the
less highly wrought: it must be packed. It must be beautifully
elaborate rather than elaborately beautiful. It must be
detached from dogma—we must keep it away from the all too
prevalent lecture platform.</p>

<p>What we should like to see, in short, is a fusion, of the extraordinary
range of poetic virtues with which our contemporary
poets confront us, into one poetic consciousness. Do we
cavil too much in assuming that no one of our poets offers us
quite enough? Should we rather take comfort in the hope
that many of their individual “personalities” are vivid enough
to offset their onesidedness, and in that way to have a considerable
guarantee of survival? We have mentioned that possibility
before, and certainly it cannot be flatly dismissed. But
I think it cannot be contested that many of these poets already
feel, themselves, a sharper responsibility, a need for a greater
comprehensiveness, for a finer and richer tactile equipment,
a steadier view of what it is that constitutes beauty of form.
They are immeasurably distant from any dry, cold perfectionism,
however; and if we cheer them in taking the path that
leads thither, it is in the hope of seeing them reach the halfway
house rather than the summit. For to go all the way is to
arrive exhausted; to go half way is to arrive with vigour....
That, however, is to interpose our own view and to lose our
detachment. We return to a reiteration of our conclusion that
American poetry is at the moment extraordinarily healthy. Its
virtues are the virtues of all good poetry, and they are sufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
to persuade us that the future of English poetry lies as
much in America as in England. Its faults are the faults of
a culture that is immature. But again, we reiterate that we
have here many cultures, and if some are immature, some
are not. Let those who are too prone to diagnose us culturally
from “Spoon River Anthology” or “Smoke and Steel” keep
in mind also Mr. Robinson’s “Merlin” and Mr. Frost’s
“North of Boston”; Mr. Fletcher’s “Goblins and Pagodas”
and Miss Lowell’s “Can Grande’s Castle.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ART">ART</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> problem of American Art is unlike that of any other
country of the present or the past. We have not here
the racial and historical foundation on which, until now, every
art has been built and so our striving (it is far too soon to speak
of success or failure) must be judged from another standpoint
than the one to be taken in viewing an art that originates with
its people or is directly transmitted from an older race. Egypt
and ancient Mexico furnish examples of the first case, Italy
and France of the second. When the latter countries were
colonized by the Greeks, Phœnicians and others, they received
a culture which could take on fresh vigour when grasped by
a new race.</p>

<p>We did not start as a new race, but as Europeans possessing
the same intellectual heritage as the men who stayed in the
parent countries. Our problem was not one of receiving the
ancient tradition from an invading or colonizing people who
brought with them an art already formed. Ourselves the invaders
and colonizers, our problem was to keep alive the ideas
that we had had in Europe, or to take over those of our new
home, or to evolve an art of our own.</p>

<p>To begin with the second possibility, the question of our
relation to the ideas of the Indians may obviously be disposed
of very briefly. The tribes encountered by the early settlers
were in a state of savagery, and this fact, together with the
constant warfare between the two races, is a sufficient explanation
why we find no influence from the red men. Even where
the Europeans encountered culture of a very high order, as in
Mexico and Peru, the remoteness of the native ideas from those
of the invading race prevented for centuries a just appreciation
of the earliest and unquestionably the greatest art produced
in the Western Hemisphere. It is only in quite recent
years that we have realized its merit, and it is unlikely that
even our present-day interest in the exotic arts will bring about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
any important influence from the Indians, although in regions
such as our Southwest and the parts of Mexico where “Americanizing”
has not yet killed their art-instinct, they are still
producing beautiful work.</p>

<p>We have, of course, retained European ideals, but they have
been conditioned by circumstances and we have not kept pace
with Europe or even followed the course of the great art-movements
until they were almost or quite superseded abroad.
Our distance from the centres of ancient and modern culture
on one hand, and the needs of building up the new continent on
the other, combined to make our people lose interest in art,
which, indeed, had never found a propitious soil among our
British forebears. The case of literature is different. The
love of it is an abiding one with the Anglo-Saxon race, and as
Shakespeare and the Bible could be read in the frontier cabin
almost as well as in London or Dublin, there was not the loss
of knowledge of literature, the break in the production of it
that we find in the case of the plastic arts.</p>

<p>It is easy to exaggerate on this score, however, forgetting that
the art-instinct accumulated in a race for centuries is not to
be lost by a period of neglect. When he goes to the museum,
the American recognizes the same masters as does the European,
but the smaller opportunity here to know the classic past
has the double effect of keeping art-lovers in America in a far
more reduced minority and at the same time of weakening the
authority of tradition.</p>

<p>Not to speak of 17th or 18th century conditions, nor even of
those of the 19th century, one need only consider the America
of to-day to realize how little opportunity our people has to
know art. In all but a few cities, Americans can learn only
from reproductions and books, though even these are an immeasurably
safer guide than the bad original works which are
usually the first to arrive. When one thinks of the European
countryside and the numberless small towns of all the old countries
where there is no museum, one may be tempted to ask
whether art conditions are so very different there. But they
are different. There will be an old church, or some houses
of a good period, or some objects in the houses, or—on the
walls of the inn—some old prints handing on the tradition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
of the great religious pictures (such things were made quite
commonly until recent times and have not entirely ceased to be
produced); a tradition of construction and of colour makes the
modern houses fit in quite acceptably with those of the past.
The centuries have built up a sense of fitness and beauty in
the making and wearing of costume; there will be some form
of folk-singing or other collective action of an artistic character,
and thus the exceptional individual, born with a strong
instinct toward art, has surroundings and a foundation that are
lacking here. A striking proof of the difference between the
two continents is the effect of the war on art-interest: whereas
in America public attention has been turned away from art to
a most marked degree, Europe is producing and buying art
with a fervour that can only be explained by the desire to get
back to essentials after the years in which people were deprived
of them.</p>

<p>Another phenomenon to be noted at this point is the dominance
of women in American art-matters. It is unknown in
any other country. The vast majority of American men are
engrossed in the drive of work, their leisure goes to sport and
to the forms of entertainment that call for the smallest amount
of mental effort. The women, with their quicker sensibility
and their recognition of art as one of the things that mark the
higher orders of life, take over the furnishing of the home and
through this and the study that their greater leisure permits
them, exert a strong influence on the purchase of art-works
for private collections and even museums. The production
of the American painter and sculptor is also much affected as
a consequence, and in the direction of conventionality. I do
not claim that the level of art in America would be greatly
improved at present if it were the men instead of the women
who took the lead; perhaps, in view of the state of appreciation
in our people, it would be lowered; but I maintain that
the fact that art is so much in the hands of women and the
suspicion among men that it carries with it some implication
of effeminacy are among the indications of American immaturity
in art-appreciation. We cannot expect an art really
representative of America until there is a foundation of regard
for his work that the artist can build on. In the old civilizations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
the artist was meeting an active demand on the part
of his people; in America, he has to seek desperately for a
living. Albrecht Dürer summed up the difference between the
two states of civilization when he wrote from Venice to a friend
in the young Germany of his day: “Oh, how I shall freeze for
this sun when I get home; here I am a gentleman, at home a
parasite.”</p>

<p>It will seem to many that even such famous words should
not be repeated in a country where art is so often mentioned
in the papers, where museums are springing up in large numbers,
where unheard-of prices are paid for the work of famous
men, and where even those who take no interest in art will
accord it a sort of halo. But the very fact that it is relegated
to the class of Sunday things instead of entering into everyday
life shows that our colonial period—in the cultural sense
of the word—is not yet passed. This should not be looked on
as discouraging; it is natural that the formation of character
and ideas should require time and I shall endeavour to show
that the development is really a rapid and healthy one. The
mistake Americans are most prone to, that of imagining the
country to have reached a mature character and a valid expression,
shows their eagerness to advance, and explains their
readiness to tear down or to build up.</p>

<p>In the presence of such a spirit, one must see the mistakes
of conservatism or of ignorance in due perspective. However
trying to those who suffer from them at the time, they cannot
fatally warp the growth that is going on. For years we retained
a tariff that obstructed the coming into the country of
works of art. That is a thing of the past, and as one of the
reasons used to defend it was that it protected American artists
against the foreigner, so, with the abolition of the tariff, there
has been more of a tendency to judge works of art for their
own qualities, without question of their nationality and without
the puerile idea of nurturing the American product by
keeping out work from abroad. How far this mistake had
gone may be judged from the fact that in a certain city of our
Far West a group of painters made a protest against the attention
given by a newspaper to an exhibition sent out from New
York, raising no question of the quality of the work, but merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
demanding that local men be spoken of when art was discussed
in the paper—which promptly acquiesced, and removed the
critic from his position. The case may seem an extreme one,
yet it illustrates the attitude of many of our collectors and even
our museum authorities who, in the name of Americanism,
are “helping to fame many, the sight of whose painting is a
miseducation,” to use a phrase that Mr. Berenson has applied
to another matter.</p>

<p>There is no question to-day but that America must evolve
along the lines of contemporary thought throughout the civilized
world. There will be a local tang to our art. Certain
enthusiasms and characteristics, as we develop them, may give
emphasis to special phases of our production, but there is no
longer the possibility of an isolated, autochthonic growth, such
as seemed to be forecast up to about the time of the Revolution.
The 18th century in America with its beautiful architecture,
its fine craftsmen, and its painting, is only less far from
the America of to-day than is the art of the Indians. We still
put up buildings and make furniture in what is called the
Colonial style, but so do we follow the even more remote
Mission style of architecture in our Western States, and attempt
to use Indian designs in decoration. The usual fate of
attempted continuings of a bygone style overtakes all these
efforts. Our materials are different, our needs are different,
our time is different. A glance at two houses, as one speeds
by in an automobile, tells us which is the real Colonial architecture,
which the imitation. At the Jumel Mansion in New
York it is easy to see which are the old parts, which the
restorations, although enough time has passed since the latter
were made to weather them to the tone of the original
places.</p>

<p>In painting, the change that occurred after we became a
republic is even more unmistakable. The English School underwent
considerable modification when its representatives here
began to work for themselves. Where Reynolds, Gainsborough,
and Lawrence were consulting the old masters with such
studious solicitude, Sir Joshua especially pursuing his enquiry
into the processes of Titian, men like Copley and Blackburn
were thrown back on such technical resources as they could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
find here and had to depend for progress on tightening their
hold on character. Copley has the true note of the primitive
in the intensity with which he studies his people, and must be
reckoned with portraitists of almost the highest order.</p>

<p>What a change in the next generation! The more independent
we are politically the more we come out of the isolation
that gave us quiet and freedom to build up the admirable
style of pre-Revolutionary days. And then there was so much
to be done in getting our new institutions to work and our new
land under cultivation, there was so much money to be made
and so much to import from Europe. It is significant that the
best painter of the period is John Vanderlyn, who had been
sent to Paris to study under Ingres. Fine artist that Vanderlyn
was, and informed by a greater tradition than Copley
knew, he never reached the impressiveness of the latter.</p>

<p>I shall not attempt to describe at any length the various
steps by which we rose from the artistic poverty which was
ours in the earlier decades of the 19th century. My purpose
is not to write even a short history of American art, but to
enquire into its character and accomplishment. The test of
these is evidently not what each period or school meant to the
American artists before or after it, but how it compares with
the rest of the world’s art at its time. The thought occurs to
one forcibly on hearing of the wildly exaggerated esteem—whether
measured by words or by money—in which the more
celebrated of American artists are held; one asks oneself how
the given work would be considered in Europe by competent
men. Few indeed are the reputations that will stand the test;
and we do not need to go abroad to apply it, for the galleries
of our large cities supply ample opportunity for the comparison.</p>

<p>Beginning with the landscape artists who are the earliest of
the modern Americans to be looked on as our possible contribution
to art, one’s most impersonal observation is that in
point of time, they, like their successors in this country, follow
the Europeans of the school to which they belong by something
like a generation. Now, art-ideas moved very rapidly in
the 19th century, and—however mechanical an indication it
may appear at first sight—it is almost a sure condemnation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
a European painter to find him in one period trying to work
with the formula of the generation before him. In America
this test does not apply so well, for we must allow for the
effect of distance and compare the American with his immediate
contemporaries abroad only in proportion to the advance
of time—which is to say in proportion to the convenience of
travel to Europe and the possibility of seeing contemporary
work here.</p>

<p>Thus when we consider that Inness, Wyant, and Martin
were born about a generation after the Barbizon men and very
nearly at the time of the French Impressionists, we shall not
say that it was to the latter school that the Americans should
have belonged. Whereas the European followers of Corot
and Rousseau were merely <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">retardataires</i> who had not the intellectual
power to seize on the ideas of their own day, the Americans
could feel a little of the joy of discoverers through having
themselves worked out some of the ideas of naturalism in their
evolution from the earlier landscape painting in this country.
And so if they add nothing to what the Frenchmen had done
already—with an incomparably greater tradition to uphold
them—our trio of nature-lovers expressed genuine sentiment,
and Homer Martin pushed on to a quality of painting that
often places him within hailing distance of the classic line
which, in France, kept out of the swamps of sentimentality
that engulfed the followers of Wyant and Inness here.</p>

<p>The cases of Winslow Homer and Albert P. Ryder have an
interest aside from the actual works of the two painters. They
are doubtless the strongest Americans of their time—and the
ones who owe the least to Europe. It must be men of such
a breed who will make real American art when we are ready
to produce it. In any case their work must rank among our
permanently valuable achievements: Homer’s for the renewal
of the sturdy self-reliance that we noted in Copley, Ryder’s for
the really noble design he so often obtained and for the grand
and moving fidelity to a vision.</p>

<p>If their independence is so valuable a factor in both men’s
work, there is also to be noted the heavy price that each paid
for having been reared in a provincial school. With a boldness
of character that recalls Courbet, Winslow Homer fails<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
utterly to hold a place in art analogous to that of the French
realist, because all the power and ability that went into his
work were unequal to compensating for his lack of the knowledge
of form, of structure, of optical effect that Ingres and
Delacroix, among others, furnished ready to the hand of
Courbet. Thus Homer’s painting goes on throughout his lifetime
quite innocent of any real concern with the central problems
of European picture-making and owes most of its strength
to the second-rate quality of illustration. One hesitates to say
that Ryder would have gone farther had he been born in
France, yet the fact of his labouring for ten or fifteen years on
many a small canvas, the very limited number of his works
which has resulted from the difficulty he had in saying the
thing that was in him, are marks of a bad training. His range
is not a wide one, but the deep beauty he infused into his pictures
is one of our chief reasons for confidence in the art-instinct
that lies dormant in our people.</p>

<p>None of the men in the next group we must consider, the
artists who enter fully into European painting, have the foundation
of talent that Ryder had. Whistler is, of course, the
painter to whom most Americans pin their faith in searching
among their compatriots for an essential figure in 19th-century
art. But take the first opportunity to see him with the great
Frenchmen of his time: beside Degas his drawing is of a sickly
weakness but slightly relieved by his sense of rhythm in line
and form; beside Manet his colour and painting seem even
more etiolated, and to save one’s feeling for him from utter
demolition one hastens to the usual American refuge of the
sentiment and—in the etchings—to the Yankee excellence of
the craftsmanship. The nocturnes really do have a felicity in
their rendering of the poetry of the night that would make us
regret their loss, and when the unhappy Whistlerian school
has been forgotten (an artist must take <em>some</em> responsibility for
his followers) we shall have more satisfaction in the butterfly
that Whistler knew himself to be, since he adopted it as his
signature. It is merit of no such slightness that we love in
Ryder, and yet when we reach Chase and Sargent we find even
less of basic talent, for which their immersion in the current
of European painting could have furnished a finely tempered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
instrument of expression. Both men show the natural bent
for painting that is often a valuable asset and often—as in
their case—a source of danger. They do not enrich our annals
by any great works, but they do the country an immense service
when they cause its students and collectors to take one of
the final steps in the direction of the live tradition of Europe.
They never appreciated what was greatest among their contemporaries,
and failing to have this grasp of the creative impulse
and of the new principles that were at work in Paris,
they offered clever manipulations of the material as a substitute.
Feeling the insufficience of this, Sargent has tried the
grave style of the early Italians in his decorations at the Public
Library in Boston. But his Biblical personages get him no
nearer to the essentials of art than the society people of whom
he has done so many likenesses. In Boston, it is Chavannes
who shows which is the great tradition of the period and how
it accords with the classic past. Sargent is perhaps most
American in his unreadiness to perceive the immense things
that Europe, modern and ancient, had to offer him.</p>

<p>Even so, with Chase and Sargent we find ourselves far
nearer the period when American artists shall partake in art-ideas
during their moment of full fertility. Our Impressionists
are only a decade or two behind the Frenchman, and while one
must not slip into a too easy trick of rating talent by the time
of its appearance, one cannot fail to be struck by the fact that
John H. Twachtman and J. Alden Weir approached the quality
of their French preceptors with far greater closeness than
that with which the Inness-Wyant group followed the Barbizon
men. Much as there is of charm and sound pictorial
knowledge in Twachtman’s work and Weir’s, one feels that
they are not yet deep enough in the great tradition to go
on to an art of their own creation, and we have to content
ourselves with giving them a place among the Impressionists of
secondary rank.</p>

<p>An interesting case among the Americans who made the serious
study of European art that began soon after the middle
of the 19th century, is that of John La Farge. We know the
history of his seeking, his copying, his associations, speculations,
and travels. All his life he is the man from the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
country asking the dead and the living representatives of the
classic tradition for help. How little we see of the man himself
in the mosaic of charming things that make up his art.
Winslow Homer exists as a personality, ill-educated and crude,
but affirmative and arresting. La Farge disappears in the
smoke of the incense that he burns before the various shrines
to which his eclecticism led him.</p>

<p>If not to be admired as a great artist, he was a man of great
gifts and a genuine appreciator of the masters. Therefore, he
is not to be confused for a moment with the ignoble <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pasticheurs</i>
who achieve office and honours in the anæmic institutions with
which we imitate the academies and salons of Europe. These
are among the youthful errors I mentioned on an earlier page—depressing
enough when one sees the acres of “decorative”
abominations which fill our state-houses, courts, and libraries,
but in reality of no great importance as a detriment to our
culture. Like the soldiers’ monuments, the dead architecture,
the tasteless manufactured articles of common use, they sink
so far below any level of art that the public is scarcely affected
by them. Only the persons trained in schools to admire the
painting of a Mr. E. H. Blashfield or the sculpture of a Mr.
Daniel C. French ever try to think of them as beautiful; the
rest of the public takes them on faith as something that goes
with the building, like the “frescoed” cupids to be found in
the halls of apartment houses or the tin cupolas and minarets
on the roof. The popular magazine-illustrators, poor as they
are, have more power to mislead than our quasi-official nonentities.</p>

<p>Between the pseudo-classic decorators and the frankly “lowbrow”
artists of the commercial publications, the posters, and
the advertisements, there is the large class of men whose work
is seen at the annual exhibitions, the dealers’ galleries, and the
American sections of the museums. They partake of the vice
of each of the other two classes: the easily learned formula for
their product being a more or less thorough schooling in some
style derived from the past, plus an optimistic or “red-blooded”
or else gently melancholy attitude toward the subject.
Velasquez has been the main victim of their caricature
in the later years, but a little Chinese, Florentine, Impressionist,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
or even Cubist style will often be added to give a look of
“modernity” to the work. As long as there is a recognizable
proficiency in drawing and painting (it is of course only for the
cheaper trade that the picture has to be guaranteed as done by
hand), the erudite patron or museum trustee is assured of the
seriousness of the artist’s intentions, while to make the thing
take with the general buyer, the most important matter is
judgment as to the type of American girl, the virile male, or
the romantic or homely landscape that our public likes to live
with.</p>

<p>The only excuse for mentioning such things in an essay on
American art is that they help to define it by contrast—for
these pictures are neither art nor American. The disease of
which they are an outward sign infects Europe almost as much
as it does our own country, and there is hardly a distinguishing
mark to tell whether the Salon picture was done in Madrid,
Berlin, or Indianapolis. A sentence from an eminent American
critic, Russell Sturgis, gives the key to the situation. He
said, “The power of abstract design is lost to the modern
world,—we must paint pictures or carve expressional groups
when we wish to adorn.” In the half generation that has
passed since these words were spoken, the French have proven
by several arts based entirely on abstract design that the power
for it was not lost to the world and that men still know the
difference between expression by form and colour and expression
by concrete ideas.</p>

<p>Throughout this survey I have taken painting as the index
to the art-instinct of America, and as we glance again at even
our best painters we see that it is on concrete ideas that they
have built: on character in portraiture with Copley, on romantic
vision with Ryder, on observation of appearances with
Homer. Precisely the reason for Whistler’s great success
among his countrymen was the promise of release he afforded
by his reaching out for the design and colour of the Orient,
with which one associates also his spoken words, offering us
“harmonies” and “symphonies” in place of the art built on
intellectual elements that we had had before. The fact that
Whistler himself was not strong enough in his grasp of tradition,
or of a nature to achieve an important result along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
lines he pointed to, does not change the issue. We had begun
to be aware of the repression of instinct that was marking
American life. We had recognized that the satisfaction of the
senses, quite as much as intellectual pleasure, is to be demanded
of art. Puritan morality and Quaker drabness had
turned us away from any such conception, and when they took
notice of art at all, it was for its educational value, either to
inculcate religious or patriotic ideas, or for its connection with
the classic past.</p>

<p>Add to this the utilitarian needs of a country that had to
build rapidly, caring for cheapness more than for permanence
(so little of the building, in fact, was intended to be permanent),
and one has an explanation of the absence of architectural
quality in the American houses of the last hundred years.
The characteristic of building in the time is seen in the lifeless
blocks of “brownstone fronts,” in the apartments that have so
little of the home about them that in the restlessness of his
search for a place to live satisfactorily, the American of the
cities has earned the name of the “van-dweller,”—one sees the
thing again in the abject monotony of farm-houses and country
residences. Their spirit, or lack of it, is continued in furniture
and decoration. One understands why Europe has been
the magic word for countless thousands of Americans. Perhaps
it was the palaces and museums that they set out to see
and that they told about on their return, but more impressive
to them—because more satisfying to their hunger for a beauty
near to their daily lives—was the sight of an Italian village
built with love for hillsides and with understanding of the forms
of the hill and of the type of construction that would suit it.
Or was it the cheeriness of the solid Dutch houses whose clear
reds and blacks look out so robustly through the green of the
trees that border the canals? The bright-coloured clothing
of the peasants became delightful to the traveller, even if
he still gave it a pitying smile when he saw it again on the
immigrant here; and the humble foreigner, anxious to fit in to
his new surroundings, hastened to tone down the vivacity of his
native costume to the colourlessness of the American farmer’s
or workman’s garb. In place of the gay pink or green stucco
of his cottage at home, the immigrant got more or less of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
sanitary plumbing, higher wages, and other material benefits,
to recompense him for the life he had left behind.</p>

<p>The life! That was the magic that Europe held for our
visitors. They might return to the big enterprises, the big
problems here, and feel that America was home because they
had a share in its growth, but their nostalgia for the old countries
continued to grow in the measure that they came to appreciate
the wisdom with which life was ordered there—as
they realized how the stable institutions, the old religions, festivals,
traditions, all the things that flower into art, had resisted
the terrific change that the industrial revolution had brought
into the 19th century. Behind all questions of the coming of
objects of art into this country or the appearance of new artists
or new schools here, lies this most pivotal matter of the elements
of art in American life. They need not be, they cannot
be the same as those in European life, but it is futile to think
of having an art here if we deny ourselves the ideas and feelings
of which art has been made—the joy and awe of life
that the Greek responded to in his marbles, the Italian in his
frescoes, the Spaniard, the Fleming, the Dutchman, and the
Frenchman in his canvases. Copying the externals of their
work without again living their lives can result only in academism—bad
sculpture and bad pictures.</p>

<p>It was not as a protest against bad art, local or foreign,
that the International Exhibition of 1913 was organized, and
it is very solidly to the credit of our public that it did not regard
the event in that negative fashion—but as a positive thing,
a revelation of the later schools of European painting of which
it had been kept in ignorance by the will of the academies here
and abroad. The “Armory Show,” as it was called, drew
forth a storm of ridicule, but it also attracted such hundreds of
thousands of visitors as no current exhibition had ever gathered
in this country before. The first contact of our public
with the arts that have succeeded Impressionism—with the
painting of Cézanne, Redon, Gauguin, van Gogh, Matisse, the
Cubists, and others—was made at this epoch-marking show.
With the jeers that it received there were not a few hosannas,
and even the vast majority of visitors—doubtful as to the exact
value of the various exhibits, knew that qualities existed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
the new schools that had never been seen here and that were
needed. Some three hundred works went from the walls of
the Armory to form a vanguard for the far more important
purchases of modern art that have since been building up our
collections; so that at the moment of this writing an exhibition
can be opened at the Metropolitan Museum which, while representing
a mere fraction of the wealth of such pictures in
American possession, gives a superb idea of the great schools
of the later 19th century and the 20th century in France. It
is worthy of note that in its response to the great show of 1913
and to the smaller ones that followed, America was only giving,
in a stronger form, the measure of a power of appreciation it
had shown before. Earlier examples of this are to be found
in the great collections of Barbizon and Impressionist pictures
here. A thing that should weigh against many a discouraging
feature of our art-conditions is the fact that an American
museum was the first in the world, and the only one during
the lifetime of Manet, to hang works by that master.</p>

<p>Returning now to our own painting, one man in this country
resisted with complete success the test of an exhibition with
the greatest of recent painters from abroad. It was Mr.
Maurice B. Prendergast, who for thirty years had been joyously
labouring at an art which showed its derivation from
the best French painting of his day, its admirable acceptances
of the teaching of Cézanne (scarcely a name even in Europe
when Mr. Prendergast first studied him), and its humorous
and affectionate appreciation of the American scenes that the
artist had known from his youth. In original and logical
design, in brilliant colour that yet had the mellowness of a
splendid wine, he expresses the modern faith in the world we
see and makes it lovable. At last we welcome an art in accord
with the finest of the ancient-modern tradition, as European
critics have since declared; yet it remains American in provenance
and in the air of unconscious honesty that has always
been a characteristic of the good work of this country.</p>

<p>The latest wave of influence to come over American art
has almost been the most far-reaching and invigorating. To
go further than this assertion, at least in the matter of individuals,
would be to forego the support of too large a part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
of that body of opinion that I know to be behind my statements
throughout this essay. Art-matters must, in the final
analysis, be stated dogmatically, but I am unwilling to speak
of the schools now developing save in a general way, especially
as the most interesting men in them have still to reach a definitive
point in their evolution. They are abreast or nearly
abreast of the ideas of Europe, and there is an admirable vigour
in the work that some individuals are producing with those
ideas. But the changes brought about by the International
are still too recent for us to expect the most important results
from them for a number of years. The general condition here
has probably never been as good before.</p>

<p>I have, till now, spoken only of the more traditional aspects
of art—the kind one finds in museums—and that last word
calls for at least a mention of the great wealth of art-objects
that are heaping up in our public collections, and in the private
galleries which so often come to the aid of the museums.</p>

<p>There is, however, another phase of our subject that demands
comment, if only as a point of departure for the study
that will one day be given to the American art that is not yet
recognized by its public or its makers as one of our main expressions.
The steel bridges, the steel buildings, the newly
designed machines, and utensils of all kinds we are bringing
forth show an adaptation to function that is recognized as one
of the great elements of art. Perhaps the process has not yet
gone far enough for us to look on these things as fully developed
works of art, perhaps we shall still need some influence
from Europe to make us see the possibilities we have here, or
again, it may be in America that the impetus to creation along
such lines will be the stronger. At all events we may feel sure
that the study of the classics, ancient and modern, which is
spreading throughout the country has, in some men, reached
a point of saturation which permits the going on to new discovery,
and we may be confident of the ability of our artists to
make good use of their advantage.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_THEATRE">THE THEATRE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Of</span> the perceptible gradual improvement in the American
popular taste so far as the arts are concerned, the theatre
as we currently engage it offers, comparatively, the least evidence.
The best-selling E. Phillips Oppenheims, Robert W.
Chamberses, and Eleanor H. Porters of yesterday have given
considerable ground to Wharton and Bennett, to Hergesheimer
and Wells. The audiences in support of Stokowski, the Flonzaley
Quartette, the Philharmonic, the great piano and violin
virtuosos, and the recognized singers, are yearly augmented.
Fine painting and fine sculpture find an increasing sober appreciation.
The circulation of <cite>Munsey’s Magazine</cite> falls, and
that of the <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite> rises. But the best play of an
American theatrical season, say a “Beyond the Horizon,” has
still to struggle for full breath, while across the street the receipts
of some “Ladies’ Night,” “Gold Diggers,” or “Bat,”
running on without end, mount to the half-million mark.</p>

<p>If one speaks of the New York theatre as the American
theatre, one speaks with an exaggerated degree of critical charity,
for the New York theatre—so far as there is any taste in
the American theatre—is the native theatre at its fullest flower.
Persons insufficiently acquainted with the theatre have a fondness
for controverting this, but the bookkeeping departments
offer concrete testimony that, if good drama is supported at
all, it is supported in the metropolitan theatre, not in the
so-called “road” theatre. The New York theatre supports
an American playwright like Booth Tarkington when he does
his best in “Clarence,” where the road theatre supports him
only when he does his worst, as in “Mister Antonio.” The
New York theatre, these same financial records prove, supports
Shaw, O’Neill, Galsworthy, Bahr, and others of their
kind, at least in sufficient degree to permit them to pay their
way, where the theatre of Philadelphia, Boston, Cleveland,
Chicago, St. Louis, Baltimore, and Pittsburgh spells failure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
for them. Save it be played by an actor or actress of great
popular favour, a first-rate piece of dramatic writing has to-day
hardly a chance for success outside of New York. These other
cities of America, though they are gradually reading better
books and patronizing better music and finer musicians, are
almost drama-deaf. “There is, in New York,” the experienced
Mr. William A. Brady has said to me, “an audience of at least
fifteen thousand for any really good play. That isn’t a large
audience; it won’t turn the play into a profitable theatrical
venture; but it is a damned sight larger audience than you’ll
be able to find in any other American city.” Let the native
sons of the cities thus cruelly maligned, before they emit their
habitual bellows of protest, consider, once they fared forth
from New York, the fate of nine-tenths of the first-rate plays
produced in the American theatre without the hocus-pocus of
fancy box-office “stars” during the last ten years.</p>

<p>The theatrical taste of America at the present time, outside
of the metropolis, is demonstrated by the box-office returns
to be one that venerates the wall-motto <em>opera</em> of Mr. William
Hodge and the spectacular imbecilities of Mr. Richard Walton
Tully above the finest work of the best of its native dramatists
like O’Neill, and above the finest work of the best of the modern
Europeans. In the metropolis, an O’Neill’s “Beyond the
Horizon,” a Galsworthy’s “Justice,” a Shaw’s “Androcles,”
at least can live; sometimes, indeed, live and prosper. But
for one respectable piece of dramatic writing that succeeds outside
of New York, there are twenty that fail miserably. The
theatrical culture of the American countryside is in the main
of a piece with that of the French countryside, and to the nature
of the latter the statistics of the French provincial theatres
offer a brilliant and dismaying attestation. Save a good play
first obtain the endorsement of New York, it is to-day impossible
to get a paying audience for it in any American city of size
after the first curiosity-provoking performance. These audiences
buy, not good drama, but notoriety. Were all communication
with the city of New York suddenly to be cut off for
six months, the only theatrical ventures that could earn their
way outside would be the Ziegfeld “Follies,” the Winter Garden
shows, “Ben Hur,” and the hack dramatizations of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
trashier best-sellers like “Pollyanna” and “Daddy Longlegs.”
This is not postured for sensational effect. It is literally true.
So true, in fact, that there is to-day not a single producer in
the American theatre who can afford to, or who will, risk the
loss of a mere four weeks’ preliminary “road” trial of a first-class
play. If he cannot get a New York theatre for his production,
he places it in the storehouse temporarily until he
can obtain a metropolitan booking rather than hazard the financial
loss that, nine times in ten, is certain to come to him.</p>

<p>More and more, the better producing managers—men like
Hopkins, William Harris, Jr., Ames, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">et al.</i>—are coming to open
their plays in New York “cold,” that is, without the former
experimental performances in thitherward cities. And more
and more, they are coming to realize to their sorrow that, unless
New York supports these plays of the better sort, they can
look for no support elsewhere. Chicago, boasting of its hospitality
to sound artistic endeavour, spent thirty-five hundred
dollars on a drama by Eugene O’Neill in the same week that it
spent forty-five thousand dollars on Al Jolson’s Winter Garden
show. Boston, one of the first cities to rush frantically
forward with proofs of its old New England culture, has turned
into a prompt and disastrous failure every first-rate play presented
in its theatres without a widely advertised star actor
during the last five years, and at the same time has made a
fortune for the astute Mr. A. H. Woods, who, gauging its culture
accurately, has sent it “Up in Mabel’s Room,” “Getting
Gertie’s Garter,” and similar spicy boudoir and hay-mow
farces, together with Miss Theda Bara in “The Blue Flame.”
(It is no secret among the theatrical managers that the only
way to bring the culture of Boston to the box-office window is
through a campaign of raw advertising: the rawer the better.
Thus the Boston Sunday newspaper advertisements of “Up in
Mabel’s Room” were made to display a girl lying on a bed,
with the suggestive catch-lines, “10,000 Visitors Weekly” and
“Such a Funny Feeling.” Thus, the advertisements of another
exhibit presented a rear view of a nude female with the
title of the show, “Oh, Mommer,” printed across the ample
buttocks. Thus, the advertisements of a Winter Garden music
show, alluding to the runway used in these exhibitions, christened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
it “The Bridge of Thighs.”) No play presented in
Philadelphia since “The Girl with the Whooping Cough”
(subsequently suppressed by the New York police authorities
on the ground of indecency) has been patronized to the extent
where it has been found necessary to call out the police reserves
to maintain order, as was the case when the play in point
was produced. Washington is a cultural wilderness; I have
personally attended the premières of ten highly meritorious
dramas in the national capital in the last six years and can
report accurately on the quality of the receptions accorded to
them. Washington would seem still to be what it was some
fifteen years or so ago when, upon the initial revelation of
Barrie’s “Peter Pan,” it essayed to boo it into permanent discard.
Baltimore, Detroit (save during the height of the war
prosperity when the poor bohicks, wops, and Greeks in the
automobile works found themselves suddenly able to buy theatre
seats regularly), Cleveland, St. Louis, San Francisco—the
story is the same. Honourable drama spells ruin; legs,
lewdness and sentimentality spell riches.</p>

<p>In comparison with the taste of the great American cultural
prairie whereon these cities are situated, the city of New
York, as I have written, looms up an æsthetic Athens. In
New York, too, there is prosperity for bare knees, bed humours,
and “Peg o’ My Heart” bathos, but not alone for
these. Side by side with the audiences that crowd into the
leg shows, the couch farces, and the uplift sermons are audiences
of considerable bulk that make profitable the production
of such more estimable things as Shaw’s “Heartbreak House,”
O’Neill’s “Emperor Jones,” the plays of St. John Ervine and
Dunsany, of Tolstoy and Hauptmann, of Bahr and Benavente
and Guitry. True enough, in order to get to the theatres in
which certain of these plays are revealed, one is compelled to
travel in a taxicab several miles from Broadway—and at times
has to sit with the chauffeur in order to pilot him to far streets
and alleyways that are not within his sophisticated ken—but,
once one gets to the theatres, one finds them full, and
their audiences enthusiastic and responsive. The culture of
the American theatre—in so far as it exists—may be said, in
fact, to be an alleyway culture. Almost without exception in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
the last dozen years and more have the best dramatists of
Europe and of our own country been driven up alleyways and
side-streets for their first American hearing. Up these dark
alleys and in these remote malls alone have they been able to
find a sufficient intelligence for their wares. Hervieu, Shaw,
Echegaray, Strindberg, Björnson, Dunsany, Masefield, Ervine,
Bergström, Chekhov, Andreyev, Benavente, O’Neill—these
and many others of eminence owe their New York introduction
to the side-street American who, in the majority of cases,
is found upon analysis to be of fifty per cent. foreign blood.
And what thus holds true of New York holds equally true in
most of the other cities. In most of such cities, that is, as have
arrived at a degree of theatrical polish sufficient to boast a little
playhouse up an ulterior mews.</p>

<p>The more general American theatrical taste, reflected perhaps
most fairly in such things as the idiotic endorsements of
the Drama League and the various “white lists” of the different
religious organizations, is—for all the undeniable fact
that it seems gradually to be improving—still in the playing-blocks
and tin choo-choo-car stage. Satire, unless it be of the
most obvious sort and approach easily assimilable burlesque,
spells failure for a producer. A point of view that does not
effect a compromise with sentimentality spells failure for a
dramatist. Sex, save it be presented in terms of a seltzer-siphon,
“Abendstern,” or the <cite>Police Gazette</cite>, spells failure for
both. The leaders in the propagation of this low taste are not
the American managers and producers, as is commonly maintained,
but the American playwrights. During the seventeen
years of my active critical interest in the theatre, I have not
encountered a single honest piece of dramatic writing from an
American hand that could not get a hearing—and an intelligent
hearing—from one or another of these regularly abused managers
and producers. And during these years I have, by virtue
of my joint professional duties as critic and co-editor of a sympathetic
literary periodical, read perhaps nine-tenths of the
dramatic manuscripts which aspiring young America has confected.
This young America, loud in its inveighing against the
managers and producers, has in the space of time indicated
produced very, very little that was worth producing, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
little has promptly found a market. A bad workman is always
indignant. But I know of no good American play that
either has not already been produced, or has not been bought
for future production. Any good play by an American will
find its producer readily enough. The first manager who read
“Beyond the Horizon” bought it immediately he laid the
manuscript down, and this, recall, was its professionally unknown
author’s first three-act play. The American theatre
has altered in this department; the last fifteen years have
wrought a tonic change.</p>

<p>No, the fault is not with the managers and producers, but
with the playwrights. The latter, where they are not mere
parrots, are cowards. Young and old, new and experienced,
talented and talentless alike, they are in the mass so many
<cite>Saturday Evening Post</cite> souls, alone dreaming of and intent
upon achieving a sufficient financial gain to transmute the Ford
into a Rolls-Royce and the Hudson Bay seal collar into Russian
sable. A baby cannot be nourished and developed physically
upon water; a theatrical public, for all its potential willingness,
cannot be developed aesthetically upon a diet of snide
writing. In the American theatre of the present time there
are not more than two, or at most three, playwrights out
of all the hundreds, who retain in their hearts a determined
and uncorrupted purpose. Take away young O’Neill, and
give a bit of ground to Miss Rita Wellman (whose accomplishment
is still too vague for fixed appraisal), and there is next
to nothing left. Flashes of talent, yes, but only flashes.
Craven’s “Too Many Cooks” and “The First Year” are
observant, highly skilful depictions of the American scene, but
they are dramatic literature only in the degree that “Main
Street” and “This Side of Paradise” are literature. With
the extraordinary “Papa,” Miss Zoë Akins gave up and surrendered—at
least temporarily—to the box-office skull and
cross-bones. Until Tarkington proves that “Clarence” was
not a happy accident in the long and unbroken line of “Up
from Nowhere,” “Mister Antonio,” “The Country Cousin,”
“The Alan from Home,” “Cameo Kirby,” “Your Humble
Servant,” “Springtime,” “Getting a Polish,” “The Gibson
Upright,” and “Poldekin,” we shall have to hold up our decision<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
on him. George Ade, the great promise of authentic
American drama, is no more; he pulled in his oars, alas, in
mid-stream. Joseph Medill Patterson, an honest dramatist,
fell through the bridge while not yet half way across. The
rest? Well, the rest are the Augustus Thomases, left-overs
from the last generation, proficient technicians with empty
heads, or youngsters still dramatically wet behind the ears.
The rest of the rest? Ticket salesmen.</p>

<p>In no civilized country in the world to-day is there among
playwrights so little fervour for sound drama as in the United
States. In England, they at least try, in a measure, to write
well; in Germany, to experiment bravely in new forms; in
France, to philosophize either seriously or lightly upon life
as they find it; in Russia, to treat soberly of problems physical
and spiritual; in Spain, to depict the Spanish heart and
conscience and atmosphere; in Ireland, to reflect the life and
thoughts, the humour and tragedy and encompassing aspirations,
of a people. And in the United States—what? In the
United States, with hardly more than two exceptions, there is
at the moment not a playwright who isn’t thinking of “success”
above honest work. Good and bad craftsmen alike,
they all think the same. Gold, silver, copper. And the result
is an endless procession of revamped crook plays, detective
plays, Cinderella plays, boudoir plays, bucolic plays: fodder
for doodles. The cowardice before the golden snake’s eye
spreads to the highest as well as to the lowest. Integrity is
thrown overboard as the ship is steered unswervingly into the
Golden Gate. The unquestionable talent of an Avery Hopwood—a
George M. Cohan—a George Bronson-Howard—is
deliberately self-corrupted.</p>

<p>The American professional theatre is to-day at once the richest
theatre in the world, and the poorest. Financially, it
reaches to the stars; culturally, with exception so small as to
be negligible, it reaches to the drains. For both of these
reaches, the American newspaper stands largely responsible.
The American newspaper, in general, regards the theatre with
contempt. My early years, upon leaving the university, were
spent on the staff of one of them—the leading daily journal
of America, it was in those days—and I shall never forget its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
attitude toward the theatre: cheap, hollow, debased. If a
play was produced by a manager who advertised extensively
in the paper, it was praised out of all reason. If a play was
produced by a manager who happened to be <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">persona non grata</i>
in the office, it was dismissed with a brief reportorial notice.
If a play was produced by a new and enterprising manager
on the night of another production in a theatre patronized by
fashionable audiences—the Empire, say—the former play,
however worthy an effort it might be, was let down with a stick
or two that there might be room to print the names of the
fashionables who were in the Empire seats. The surface of
things has changed somewhat since then, but the situation at
bottom is much the same. A talented young reviewer writes
honestly of a tawdry play in the <cite>Evening Sun</cite>; the producer
of the play, an office favourite, complains; and the young reviewer
is promptly discharged. A moving picture producer
takes half-page advertisements of his forthcoming <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">opus</i> in the
New York newspapers, and the screen exhibit, a piece of trash,
is hailed as a master work. Let a new drama by Gerhart
Hauptmann be presented in the Park Theatre to-night and
let Mr. John Barrymore also appear at eight-thirty in a play
by some obscure hack at the Empire, and there will not be a
single newspaper in the whole of New York City that will not
review the latter flashy affair at the expense of the former.</p>

<p>It is not that the newspapers, in New York as elsewhere, are
dishonest—few of them are actually dishonest; it is that they
are suburban, shoddy, cheap. With only four exceptions that
I can think of, the American newspaper, wherever you find it,
treats the theatre as if it were of very much less importance
than baseball and of but a shade more importance than a rape
in Perth Amboy, New Jersey. Two columns are given freely
to the latest development in bootlegging in Harlem, and a begrudged
half-column to a play by John Galsworthy. A society
woman is accused by her husband of having been guilty of
adultery with a half-breed Indian, and the allotment is four
columns. On the same day, a Shakespearean production is
mounted by the most artistic producer in the American theatre,
and the allotment of space is two-thirds of a column. The
reply of the newspapers is, “Well, we give the public what it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
wants! And it is more greatly interested in scandal than in
Shakespeare.” Have not then the theatrical managers the
right to reply in the same terms? And when they do, some of
them, disgustedly reply in the same terms, what is the hypocritical
appraisal of their offerings that the selfsame newspapers
vouchsafe to them? If the New York <cite>Times</cite> devotes three
columns to a dirty divorce case, I fail to see how it can with
justice or reason permit its theatrical reviewer indignantly to
denounce Mr. A. H. Woods in the same issue for devoting
three hours to a dirty farce.</p>

<p>The American drama, like the American audience, lacks repose.
This is ever logically true of a new civilization. Time
must mellow the mind and heart before drama may achieve
depth and richness; time must mellow the mind and heart before
an audience may achieve the mood of calm deliberation.
Youth is a rare and precious attribute, but youth, for all its
fine courage and derring-do, is inclined to be superficial. Its
emotions and its reactions are respectively of and to the primary
colours; the pastels it is impatient of. The American
theatre, drama, and audience are the theatre, drama, and audience
of the metaphysical and emotional primary colours: substantial,
vivid, but all too obvious and glaring. I speak, of
course, generally. For there are a few notable exceptions to
the rule, and these exceptions portend in the American theatre
the first signs of the coming dawn. A producer like Arthur
Hopkins, perhaps the first American man of the theatre gifted
with a genuine passion for fine and beautiful things and the
talent with which to do—or at least try to do—them; a dramatist
like young O’Neill, permitting no compromise or equivoke
in the upward sweep of his dynamic imagination; an actor
like Arnold Daly and an actress like Margaret Anglin to
whom failure in the service of honest drama means absolutely
nothing—these are they who inspire our faith in the future.
Nor do they stand alone. Hume and Moeller, Jones, Peters,
Simonson and Bel-Geddes, Glaspell, Wellman and Pottle—such
youngsters, too, are dreaming their dreams, some of them,
true enough, still silly dreams, but yet dreams. And the
dreaming spreads, spreads....</p>

<p>But in its slow and brave ascent, the American theatre is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
still heavily retarded by the insular forces that, as in no other
theatre save the English, operate in the Republic. The fight
against outworn convention is a brave and bitter fight, but
victory still rests mainly on the banners of the Philistines.
The drama that dismisses sentimentality for truth, that seeks
to face squarely the tragedy and comedy of love and life,
that declines to pigeon-hole itself, and that hazards to view
the American scene with cosmopolitan eyes, is confronted at
every turn by the native Puritanism (as often shammed as
inborn), and by the native parochialism and hypocrisy. The
production that derides all stereotype—all the ridiculous and
mossy rubber-stamps—is in turn derided. The actor or
actress who essays to filter a rôle through the mind of a human
being instead of through the mind of a rouged marionette is
made mock of. Here, the playgoing public finds its leaders
in three-fourths of the newspaper reviewing chairs, chairs influenced,
directly or indirectly, by an intrinsic inexperience
and ignorance, or by an extrinsic suggestion of “policy.”</p>

<p>The American theatre and drama have long suffered from
being slaves to the national hypocrisy. Only on rare occasions
have they been successful in casting off the shackles, and then
but momentarily. The pull against them is stubborn, strong.
Cracking the black snake across their backs are a hundred
padrones: newspapers trembling at the thought of offending
their advertisers, religious orders poking their noses into what
should not concern them, corrupt moral uplift organizations
and lecherous anti-vice societies itching for the gauds of publicity,
meddling college professors augmenting their humble
wage by writing twenty-dollar articles on subjects they know
nothing about for the Sunday supplements, ex-real estate reporters
and divorcée interviewers become “dramatic critics,”
notoriety seeking clergymen, snide producers trying to protect
their snide enterprises from the dangers of the invasion of
truth and beauty. Let a group of drama-loving and theatre-loving
young men, resourceful, skilful, and successful, come
upon the scene, as the Washington Square Players came, let
them bring flashes of authentic dramatic art into their native
theatre, and against them is promptly hurled the jealous irony
of the Old Guard that is dead, but never surrenders. Let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
a young playwright like Zoë Akins write an admirable fantastic
comedy (“Papa”), and against her are brought all the
weapons of the morals-in-art mountebanks. Let a producer
like Hopkins break away from the mantel-leaning histrionism
and palm-pot investiture, and against him is brought up the
curt dismissal of freakishness.</p>

<p>The native theatre, for all the fact that it is on the way,
is not yet ready for such things as demand a degree of civilization
for receptive and remunerative appreciation. The “Pegs
o’ My Heart” and “Pollyannas,” the “Turn to the Rights”
and “Lightnin’s” still make millions, while the bulk of finer
things languish and perish. I speak, remember, not of the
theatre of one city, but of the theatre of the land. This theatre,
considering it in so far as possible as a unit, is still not
much above the Midway Plaisance, the honk-a-tonk, the Sunday
School charade. That one, or maybe two, foreign national
theatres may not be much better is no apology. Such foreign
theatres—the French, say—are less national theatres than one-city
theatres, for Paris is France. But the American theatre
spreads from coast to coast. What it spreads, I have herein
tried to suggest.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ECONOMIC_OPINION">ECONOMIC OPINION</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">IF</span> there were conscious restriction upon the expression of
opinion in America, this essay would possess the pompous
certainty of an official document. Instead of threading its
hazardous way through a mass of confused thought, it would
record in formal terms acceptable utterance. In fact, the very
restrictions upon thought and speech, with the aid of scissors
and a license to speech, could easily be turned into a statement
of the reputable theory of the welfare of the community.</p>

<p>Unluckily, however, American life has not been arranged to
make matters easy for the interpreter of economic opinion.
Every American is conscious of a right to his own opinion
about “why all of us taken together are as well off as we are”
and “why some of us are better off and others of us worse off
than the average of us.” Whether this privilege comes from
the Bill of Rights, the constitution of the United States, or his
Simian ancestry, he could not say; but he is fully assured that
it is “inalienable” and “indefeasible.” No restriction of
birth, breeding, position, or wealth limits his right to an
opinion or persuades him to esteem his more fortunate neighbour’s
more highly than his own. Nor do intellectual limitations
check the flow of words and of ideas. No one is examined
upon the growth of industrialism, the institutions which
make up the economic order, or the nature of an industrial
problem before he is allowed to speak. In fact, the idea that
a knowledge of the facts about the subject under discussion, or
of the principles to be applied to it, is essential to the right
to an opinion is a strange notion little understood here. Even
if occasionally some potentate attempts a mild restriction upon
the spoken or the written word, it checks only those who talk
directly and therefore clumsily. Its principal effect is through
provocation to add mightily to the volume of opinion.</p>

<p>The result is a conglomerate mass of opinion that sprawls
through the known realm of economics and into regions uncharted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
The mighty men of finance spin a theory of national
welfare in terms of foreign concessions no more glibly than
the knights of the road in solemn convention solve with words
the riddle of unemployment. The newly enfranchised women
compete with the members of the Dynamite Club in proposals for
setting the industrial cosmos in order. Economic opinion bobs
up in the financial journals, “the labour press,” the periodicals
of the “learned” societies, and in all the “Christian” advocates.
It shows itself boldly in political speeches, in directors’
reports, in public hearings, and in propagandist sheets. It
lurks craftily in editorials, moving pictures, drawing-room lectures,
poems, cartoons, and hymns. It ranges from the
sonorous apologies for the existing order voiced by the Aaron
Baal Professor of Christian Homiletics in the Midas Theological
Seminary to the staccato denunciation of what is by the
Sons of Martha Professor of Proletarian Tactics in the Karl
Marx College for Workers.</p>

<p>A mere semblance of order is given to this heterogeneous mass
of opinion by the conditions which make it. A common system
of legal, business, and social usages is to be found the country
over. This has left its impress too firmly in the assumptions
which underlie thought to allow this material to be separate
bits from so many mental universes. The prevailing
scheme of economic life is so definitely established as to force
its imprint upon the opinion that moves about it. Acceptable
opinion is created in its likeness, and unacceptable opinion becomes
acceptable opinion when the negatives are skilfully extracted.
Protestants are concerned rather with eliminating the
“evils” of “capitalism” than with eradicating it root and
branch. Protestantism is rather a variant of orthodox doctrine
than an independent system of thought. Radical opinion that
is likely to pass the decent bounds of negation is kept small
in volume by a press which allows it little upon which to feed.
Accordingly, varied doctrines wear the semblance of unity.</p>

<p>Such elements, however, do not free this adventure into
speculation from its perils. They merely make the hazards
mortal. In the paragraphs below the economic opinion in
America is recklessly resolved into four main classes. These
are the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez-faire</i> opinion of the mid-19th century, the conventional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
“case for capitalism,” the protestant demand for
“control,” and the academic insistence upon conscious “direction”
of industrial change. Radical opinion gets a competent
judgment elsewhere in this volume. Even in this bold outline
the opinions of small minorities are lost to sight, and views and
doctrines, seemingly alien to the authors who know their subtle
differences, are often blurred into a single picture. To avoid
the charge that the lion and the lamb have been pictured as
one, no names have been called. Here as elsewhere particulars
will rise up to curse their generalizations, and the whole will
be found to be entirely too scanty to be disbursed into its parts.
But the chance must be taken, and, after all, truth does not
reside in copy-book mottoes.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The current types of economic opinion in this country all
have a common origin. The men who express them are but
a scant generation or two removed from the country or the
small town. The opinions are so many variants of a stream
of thought which goes back to a mid-19th century America
of small towns and open country. This primitive economic
opinion was formed out of the dust of the ground in the likeness
of an exploitative America. The conditions which shaped
it might be set forth in two lines of a school history thus: First,
abundant natural resources; second, a scanty population; and
third, the principle of letting the individual alone.</p>

<p>It was a chance at an economic opportunity which made
America of the 19th century the “land of promise.” The raw
materials of personal wealth were here in soil, stream, and mine.
The equipment necessary to the crude exploitative farming of
the time was easy to possess. Since there was an abundance,
the resources essential to a chance at a living were to be had
for the asking. One with enterprise enough to “go it alone”
lived upon what he himself and his wealth in wife and children
produced. He did not have to drive a shrewd bargain
for the sale of his labour nor purchase the wherewithal to be
fed and clothed in a market. There was no confusing scheme
of prices to break the connection between effort and reward;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
opportunity and responsibility went hand in hand; success
or failure was of one’s own fashioning. Where nature does
most, man claims all; and in rural America men were quite
disposed to claim personal credit for nature’s accomplishments.
Since ample resources smothered even mediocre effort in plenty,
the voice of chronic failure which blamed circumstance, fate,
or “the system” was unheard. A freedom to have and to
hold economic resources plentiful enough to supply all was
the condition of material prosperity.</p>

<p>Even when the lure of natural resources drew men from
agriculture to industrial exploitation conditions did not change
materially. The population of the new towns for a while kept
at least one foot upon the soil. When at last the city possessed
its people, aliens came out of Southeastern Europe to do the
“dirty work,” and the native born passed up into administrative,
clerical, or professional positions. The alternative of
farm employment and the rapid expansion of industry fixed
a rough minimum beneath which wages could not fall. The
expanding machine technique with large scale production by
quantity methods turned out an abundance of goods evidenced
alike in lower prices and in higher standards of living. The
“captains of industry” were regarded by the community as
the creators of the jobs which they dispensed and as the efficient
cause of the prosperity of the neighbourhood. The
trickle of immigration that swelled to a “stream” and rose
to a “tide” is an eloquent testimonial of the time paid by the
peasantry of Europe to the success of the American system of
letting the individual alone in his business.</p>

<p>These conditions brought forth the lay economic theory
acceptable to the national community. Its precepts came from
experience, rather than from books; by intuition, rather than
by reason. The welfare of the individual and the wealth of
the nation were alike due to free institutions. In business
and industry the individual was to be free to do as he pleased
unless specifically forbidden by the State. The State was
powerless to interfere with the individual unless granted specific
“constitutional” authority to do so. Each knew what
he wanted and was able to take care of himself. The interests
of all were an aggregate of the interests of individuals. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
prevailing scheme of institutions was accepted as a part of
the immutable world of nature. Private property, if defended
at all, was good because it gave the individual security and
enabled him to enjoy the fruits of his own labour. The right
of contract, exercised in a market characterized by “higgling,”
gave one an occasional adventure beyond the horizon
of a household economy. If perchance the individual stumbled
into a bad bargain occasionally, so much the better. The
mistake was a useful exercise in the development of the cardinal
virtue of self-reliance. When the coming of industrialism
made contract the basis of all industrial relations, the older
justification was still used. Competition, with which it was
always associated, was regarded as the prime agency in the
organization of industry. It forced the elements of production
into order and exercised a moral restraint over them. Under
its régime men were rewarded in accordance with their deserts.
In general, it was true beyond peradventure that “opportunity”
knocked once “at every gate”; that there was “plenty
of room at the top”; that each built the ladder by which he
rose; and that even the humblest was “master of his
fate.”</p>

<p>Out of such raw materials there was fashioned a body of
professional economic theory. In a sense it was an imported
product; for its earlier statement was that of English “classical”
economics. But in reality it was the return of an earlier
export, for accepted theory had been made from crude individualistic
notions which England had got from America. In
addition, at the hands of American economists it received a
far more elaborate and articulate statement than had been
given it overseas. These theorists used subtle analysis, ponderous
logic, and circumlocution; but their decorous processes
brought them to much the same conclusions that practical men
gained from their limited experiences. Its strength and its
acceptability were wholly due to the precision and verbiage
with which it reduced to formal terms the common-sense economics
of the day.</p>

<p>In its terms the economic order is made up of individuals.
Each of these is actuated by the motive of self-interest. Each
has for disposal personal services, goods, or property rights.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
Each must live upon goods and services purchased from others.
Each must compete with his fellows in the sale of his wares
and the purchase of his articles of livelihood. Because of the
competition of sellers the wages of labour, the profits of capital,
and the prices of goods cannot be forced to untoward
heights. Because of the competition of buyers they cannot be
driven too low. The equilibrium of this double competitive
process assures to each a return which represents the just value
of the service, the property right, or the good. Prices, by moving
up and down in response to changing conditions, stimulate
and retard consumption and production. Their very movement
constantly reallocates resources to the production of a
variety of goods and services in just the proportion which the
consumers demand. In this theory the institutions which
comprise the framework of the economic order are taken for
granted. It has no place for an interference by the State with
“private business.” It regards monopoly as a thing to be
abjured, whether appearing as a capitalistic combine or as a
union of workingmen. In the Eden of free enterprise the community’s
resources yield all they have and competition rewards
justly all the faithful who by serving themselves serve
society. It is small wonder that sermons were preached upon
“The Relation of Political Economy to Natural Theology.”</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The conditions which made the economic opinion of the
America of small towns and open country are gone. With
their passing the older theories have been reshaped to new
purposes. There are no longer free economic opportunities
for all comers. Natural resources have been appropriated, and
the natural differences between men have been enhanced by
the artificial ones of ownership and inheritance. Wealth and
control have alike been stripped from the many and concentrated
in the few. The prevailing unit in business is the corporation.
Establishments have been gathered into industries,
and these have been articulated into a mighty industrial system,
with its established rights, its customary ways of doing
things, and its compulsions upon those who serve it. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
older personal relation of “master” and “servant” abides
only in indices of the records of the law courts. The contract
of employment is now between a “soulless” but “legal entity”
and a mere creature of flesh and blood. The more human individual,
the survival of a less mechanical age, no longer lives
upon the fruit of his individual toil. His welfare is pent in
between his wages and the prices which he must pay for his
necessities. Beyond this immediate bargain lies a mysterious
economic system filled with unknown causes which threaten
his income and even his employment. Those who possess have
come into succession to those who ventured. In short, free
enterprise has given way to an established system.</p>

<p>These events have left their mark upon economic opinion.
It is altogether fitting that those who fell heir to the wealth
piled up by free enterprise should gain its outer defences of
theory and dialectic. So the older economics, with its logic
and its blessing, has come as a legacy to those who have. Its
newer statement, because of its well-known objective, may be
called “the case for capitalism.” In its revision the adventurous
militarism bent upon exploitation has given way to a
pacifistic defence of security, possession, and things as they
are.</p>

<p>In outward form few changes were necessary to convert the
older theory of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez-faire</i> into a presentable case for capitalism.
A more rigid and absolute statement of the classical
doctrine was almost enough. In its terms the economic order
is independent of other social arrangements. It is an automatic,
self-regulating mechanism. Over it there rules an immutable
and natural “law of supply and demand.” This
maintains just prices, prevents exploitation, adjusts production
and consumption to each other, secures the maximum of goods
and services from the resources at hand, and disburses incomes
in accordance with the merits of men and the verity of things.
So just and impartial is the operation of this law that interference
by the State amounts to meddlesome muddling. It
cannot override natural law; therefore it should not.</p>

<p>It differs most from the older economics in the more explicit
statement of the function of institutions. The growing inequality
of income, of control, and of opportunity have presented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
facts that have to be faced. But even here, instead
of contriving new defences, the advocates of capitalism have
refurbished the older ones. The thing that is finds its justification
in that which was. Property rights are to be preserved
intact, because private property is essential to personal opportunity;
just as if the propertyless did not exist and each was
to win his living from his own acres or his own shop. The
right of contract is not to be abridged, because the interests of
both parties are advanced by a bargain between equals; just
as if the corporate employer and the individual employé were
alike in their freedom, their capacity to wait, and their power
to shape the terms of the bargain. Prices are to be self-determined
in open market, because competition will best
reconcile the conflicting interests of buyers and sellers; just
as if there was no semblance of monopoly among producers,
no open price agreements, and no informal understandings.
Individual initiative is not to be abridged, because it creates
the wealth of the nation; just as if routine had no value for
efficiency and the masses of men still had discretion in economic
matters. The arrangements which make up the economic
order find their validity in the symbolic language of
ritual rather than in a prosaic recital of current fact.</p>

<p>This defence crosses the frontier which separates the economic
from the political order only to appropriate the prestige
of democracy. Its real concern is the preservation of the
prevailing system wherein business controls industry for purposes
of profit. Its formal solicitation is lest “the form of
government” be changed. This concern finds expression in
veneration for the work of the “fathers” (rather young men,
by the way), not of machine technology and business enterprise,
but of “representative government” and of “constitutional
authority.” Its creed becomes propaganda, not for the
defence of business, the security of corporations, or the preservation
of managerial immunities, but for the defence of the
nation, the security of America, and the preservation of “constitutional”
rights. The newer economic arrangements are
masked behind political rights and given the values of the political
institutions which antedate them by many decades. In
short, the staunchest defenders of the prevailing economic system<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
believe that “their economic preferences are shared by
the constitution of the United States.”</p>

<p>If we may borrow a term from its advocates, this body of
opinion must be pronounced “theoretical.” In their speech
a “theory” is a generalization which goes much further than
its particulars warrant. In that sense their conclusions are not
“practical.” The essential question with which this body of
opinion is concerned is whether the scheme of institutions
which focus upon profit-making make the members of the
community, severally and collectively, as well off as they
ought to be. It seems offhand that a realistic defence of the
prevailing order might be convincingly formulated. At any
rate, “the case for capitalism” is good enough to get into the
records. Instead, its advocates have confused their own pecuniary
success with the well-being of the community and have
argued that because profits have been made the system is good.
Like the classical economists they vindicate the system by
assumption.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>In the wake of the new industrialism there has come an
economic opinion of protest. It is being gradually formulated
by professional men, by farmers, by trade unionists, and by the
younger business men who have escaped being “self-made.”
Its hesitating and confused statement is due to the disturbed
conditions out of which it comes. The varied interests of its
many authors prevents unity of words or of principles. Its
origin in the contact of minds steeped in the older individualism
with the arresting facts of the newer economic order explains
its current inarticulate expression. It can be set forth briefly
only by subordinating the reality of variety to the tendencies
which are clearly inherent within it.</p>

<p>The objective of this newer opinion is a modification of the
prevailing order, rather than its overthrow. It is quite conscious
of defects in its arrangements and knows that its fruits
are not all good. It has never considered the question of the
efficiency or inefficiency of the system as a whole. The older
individualistic notions are strong enough to give an intuitive
belief that the theory of the control of industry by business for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
profit is essentially sound. But it would eliminate the bad,
patch up the indifferent, and retain the good. It would set up
in the government an external authority which through regulation
and repression would make business interests serve the
community. Its faith is in private enterprise compelled by the
State to promote “public welfare.” Its detail can best be
suggested by typical illustrations.</p>

<p>There is, first of all, the attitude of the protestants towards
freedom of contract. They accept the prevailing theory that
the relations of buyer and seller, employer and employé, owner
and agent, can safely be left to the free choice of all concerned.
But they point out that in practice the principle does not give
its assumed results. For, whereas the theory assumes the parties
to be equal in their power to determine the terms of the
contract, it is a matter of common knowledge that employers
and labourers occupy unequal bargaining positions. They
would leave relations to be determined by free bargaining; but,
as a preliminary, they would attempt to establish equality of
bargaining power. To that end they would have the contract
made by “collective bargaining” between employers and employés
“through representatives” chosen by each. Moreover,
they would use the State to better the position of the
weaker party. Thus legislation has been passed depriving
employers of their right of requiring employés, as a condition
of employment, not to remain members of labour unions. Although
the courts have found such legislation to be “an arbitrary
interference with the liberty of contract which no government
can justify in a free land,” its advocates will insist
that their aim has been only “to establish that equality in position
between the parties in which liberty of contract begins.”</p>

<p>There is, in the next place, a growing opinion among the
protestants that the State is “a moral agent” and should
determine the rules under which business is to be carried on.
They point out that in business there are bad as well as good
conditions, that business men engage in proper as well as in
improper practices, and that some activities harm while others
help the community. In many instances the employer finds
it to his advantage to establish conditions which the interests
of the workers and of the consumers require. In others, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
elevation of standards waits upon the pleasure of the most
inconsiderate employer. The prohibition of child labour, the
shortening of the working day, and the payment of a minimum
wage may be advantageous alike to labourers and to the community;
yet these innovations involve an increase in cost and
cannot be made against the competition of the producer who
will not establish them. In such cases it is the duty of the
State to establish minimum conditions which must be met by
all employers. The imposition of such standards in no way
affects the system under which business is carried on; for
the competition of rival sellers can be just as acute and just
as considerate of the public, if all of them are forced to pay
their employés a living wage, as if they are all free to force
wages down to starvation. Upon this theory the State has established
uniform weights and measures, prohibited the use
of deleterious chemicals, stopped the sale of impure food, provided
compensation for the human wear and tear of industry,
and established minimum standards of safety, health, and
service.</p>

<p>There is, finally, a growing opinion that in some industries
the profit-making motive must be superseded by some other.
In the railway industry it has been repeatedly shown that the
pecuniary interest of the management fails to coincide with
that of either the owners or of the shippers. Long ago the
determination of charges for service was put beyond the discretion
of the officials. Of late there has been an increasing
tendency to make accounts, services, expenditures, valuations,
and other matters meet standards of public service. When
this has been effected, as it will be, the officials of the roads
will become mere subordinates responsible to a public authority.
Then profit-making as a guide to administration will
have given way to an official judgment of results in terms of
established standards. Then it will be discovered that public
control formally rejected has been achieved by indirection.
But many times ere this American opinion has come by devious
paths to goals which its individualism has not allowed it to
regard as quite desirable.</p>

<p>For the moment the medley of opinion here roughly characterized
as a demand for control is dominant. Its proponents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
are almost as naïve as the advocates of capitalism in a belief
in the essential goodness of a mythical system of “free enterprise.”
They differ from them in placing greater emphasis
upon voluntary associations and in demanding that the State
from without compel business to serve the common good.
As yet they have formulated no consistent theory of economics
and no articulate programme for achieving their ends. Without
a clear understanding of the development of industry and
of the structure of the economic order, they are content to face
specific problems when they meet them. They are far from
ready to surrender an inherited belief in an individualistic
theory of the common good.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The changes of the last four decades, which make up “The
Industrial Revolution in America,” have left their mark upon
the economics of the schools. If there was a time when the
thought of the professed economists was a thing apart from
the common sense of the age, it ended with the coming of industrialism.
Differ as it may in phrase, in method, and in
statement, the economics in solid and dull treatises reflects, as
it has always reflected, the opinions of the laity. If there
were agreement among the sorts of men who gather at ball
games and in smoking cars, the books on economics would all
read alike. But when the plumber differs from the banker
and the scrub woman refuses to take her ideas from the coupon
clipper, it is futile to expect mere economists to agree. To
some, the classical doctrine still serves as a sabbatical refuge
from modern problems. Others, who “specialize” in trusts,
tariffs, and labour are too busy being “scientific” to formulate
general opinions. Still others insist upon creating a new
economics concerned with the problem of directing industrial
development to appointed ends. Each of these schools has a
membership large enough to allow dissension within the ranks.</p>

<p>The revolt against the classical economics began when it
encountered modern fact. Beyond the pale of doctrine taught
by certified theorists appeared studies upon corporations, international
trade, railway rates, craft unionism, and other matters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
of the newer fact. For a time those who studied these
subjects were content to describe in superficial terms the results
of their observations. But as facts accumulated they provoked
generalizations at variance with the accepted principles
of the older competitive theory. At the same time the
rise of a newer history concerned with development rather
than chronology, a new ethics that recognized the existence
of a social order, and a new psychology that taught that the
content of men’s behaviour is poured in by the environment,
together made the foundations of the older economics very
insecure.</p>

<p>For a time this protest found expression only in critical
work. The picture of an economic order as a self-regulating
mechanism, peopled with folk who could not but serve the
community in serving themselves became very unreal. The
complexity of industrialism made it hard to believe that the
individual had knowledge enough to choose best for himself.
The suspicion that frequently thought follows action made it
hard to continue to believe in man’s complete rationality. The
idea that incomes are different because opportunities are different
led to a questioning of the justice of the ratings of men
in the market. The unequal division of income made impossible
pecuniary calculations in which each man counted for
one and only for one. With these assumptions of 19th-century
economics passed “the economic man,” “the Crusoe economy,”
and the last of the divine theories, that of “enlightened
self-interest.” It was no longer possible to build a defence of
the existing order upon “the hedonistic conception of man”
as “a lightning calculator of pleasures and pains, who oscillates
like a homogeneous globule of desire of happiness under the
impulse of stimuli that shift him about the area, but leave
him inert.”</p>

<p>The most immediate effect of this criticism was a change
in method. The older process of juggling economic laws out
of assumptions about human nature, human motives, and the
beneficence of competition lost prestige. It was evident that
if the system was to be appraised the facts must be had. Accordingly
a veritable multitude of facts, good, bad, and mostly
indifferent were treasured up. This process of garnering information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
soon made it evident that the facts about the relationship
of industry to the welfare of the community were too
varied and too numerous to be separately catalogued. Since
only totals could be used, economics came to rely upon facts
presented in the quantitative language of statistics.</p>

<p>But since facts are not possessed of the virtue of self-determination,
they did not yield an opinion which was very
relevant or very truthful. Their use was for the moment
nothing more than a substitution of the superstition of facts
for that of logic. The facts were of value, because when properly
interpreted they gave the story of what the economic
system had done. But without the aid of standards it was
impossible to determine whether it had worked well or ill,
whether it had much or little to give in return for the solicitous
concern about it. It was evident that modern industrialism
was developing without conscious guidance. As long as no
goal was fixed it was impossible to tell whether industrial development
was proceeding in the right direction. As long as we
were unmindful of the kind of society we wished ours to be,
we could not appraise its accomplishments. Without standards
all that could be said was that the system had worked as
well as it had worked and that we were as well off as we were
well off. The problem, therefore, became one of judging the
system on the basis of the facts by means of standards.</p>

<p>Thus the newer economics has been of service in stating the
problem with which opinion must be concerned. The “prevailing”
economic order is one of many schemes of arrangements
for making industry serve the purposes of the community.
The system has been slowly evolved out of the institutions
of the past, is constantly being affected by circumstances,
and for the future is capable of conscious modification.
How well it has served its purpose cannot be attested by
an abstract argument proceeding from assumptions about human
nature and the cosmos. A judgment upon its relative
goodness or badness requires an appraisal of the facts in terms
of standards. These standards must be obtained from our
notions of the kind of society we want this to be. These notions
must proceed from a scientific study of the properties
of things and the needs of human beings. That judgment will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
be one not of goodness or badness, but of the relative merits of
a very human scheme of arrangements compared with its
alternatives.</p>

<p>The economists are reluctant to pass a judgment upon the
prevailing order. The relevant facts are too scanty and the
standards too inexact to warrant an appraisal of the virtues
and the vices of “capitalism.” They distrust the eulogies of
apologists because they do not square with the known facts.
They are not convinced by the reformers, because they fear
that they know as little about their own schemes as they do
about current arrangements. They insist that a general judgment
must be a progressive affair. The system will change
through gradual modification; the larger problem will be solved
by attention to an endless succession of minor problems. Each
of these must be met with the facts and with an ideal of what
our society should be. They have too little faith in the rationality
of the collect to believe that problems can be faced in
battalions or that a new order can emerge as a work of creation.
They have little fear for “the future of the nation,” if
only problems can be intelligently handled as they emerge.
Their attitude towards the present system is one, neither of
acceptance nor of rejection, but of doubt and of honest inquiry.
Their faith is neither in the existing order nor in a
hand-me-down substitute, but in a conscious direction of the
process of change.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>This tedious narrative has failed entirely in its purpose, if
it has not revealed the strength and the weakness of economic
opinion in America. Its merits stand out boldly in the preceding
paragraphs; its defects are too striking to be concealed.
The reader has already been informed; but the writer must
inform himself. The essay, therefore, will close with an explicit
statement of some three of the more obvious characteristics.</p>

<p>First, its most striking characteristic is its volume. In
quantity it contains enough verbal and intellectual ammunition
to justify or to wreck a dozen contradictory economic
orders. If, in an orderly way, opinion became judgment and
judgment ripened into the society of to-morrow, it would stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
condemned. For little of it has a practical consequence and
our ways of expression are very wasteful. But it also affords
a harmless outlet for the dangerous emotions aroused by the
wear and tear of everyday work in a humdrum universe. And,
if it is true that we are, all of us, Simians by lineage, this is by
far the most important function it serves.</p>

<p>Second, it is grounded none too well in information and
principles. The ordinary mortal is busied with his own
affairs. He lacks the time, the patience, and the equipment
necessary to get at the facts about the material welfare of the
nation. In the most casual way he makes up his mind, using
for the purpose a few superficial facts, a number of prejudices,
and a bit of experience. He has little idea of where we are
in the course of social development, of the forces which have
brought us here, or of where we ought to be going. Since the
opinions of groups and of the nation are aggregates of individual
opinion, the ideas of those who have an intellectual right
to speak are not a large part of the compound.</p>

<p>Third, despite its crudeness and variety, it possesses elements
of real value. Its very volume creates at least a statistical
probability that some of it is of high quality. The waste
of much of it gives the rest a real chance of expression in
social policy. The common features of industrialism are giving
to men something of a common experience out of which
there will come a more or less common-sense appreciation of
problems and of ideals. This will dictate the larger features
of a future social policy. The particularized opinion which
finds expression in the detailed formulation of programmes
must be left to the experts. The great masses of men must
learn that these problems are technical and must trust the
judgment of those who know. Despite the record of halting
development and of confused statement, the pages above indicate
that the economic opinion in America is coming slowly
to an appreciation of the factors upon which “the good life
for all” really rests.</p>

<p>But enough. Opinion by being economic does not cease to
be opinion, and an essay about it is only more opinion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="RADICALISM">RADICALISM</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> first obstacle to an assessment of radicalism in America
is the difficulty of discovering precisely what American
radicalism is. According to his enemies, a radical is a person
whose opinions need not be considered and whose rights need
not be respected. As a people we do not wish to understand
him, or to deal with what he represents, but only to get him
out of sight. We deport him and imprison him. If he writes
a book, we keep it out of the schools and libraries. If he publishes
a paper, we debar it from the mails. If he makes a
speech, we drive him out of the hall and shoo him away from
the street-corner. If by hook or crook he multiplies himself
to considerable numbers, we expel his representatives from
legislative chambers, break up his parades, and disperse his
strikes with well-armed soldiery.</p>

<p>These being the associations which cluster about the word,
it has naturally become less a definition than a weapon. Statisticians
in the Federal Trade Commission publish certain figures
dealing with the business of the packing-houses—a Senator
loudly calls these devoted civil servants “radicals,” and they
are allowed to resign. A labour leader, following the precedent
of federal law established for over a half a century,
espouses the eight-hour day, but because he has the bad taste
to do so in connection with the steel industry, he becomes a
“radical,” and is soundly berated in the press. If one were
to ask the typical American Legion member how he would
describe a radical—aside from the fact that a radical is a
person to be suppressed—he would probably answer that a
radical is (a) a pro-German, (b) a Russian or other foreigner,
(c) a person who sends bombs through the mail, (d)
a believer in free love, (e) a writer of free verse, (f) a painter
of cubist pictures, (g) a member of the I.W.W., (h) a Socialist,
(i) a Bolshevist, (j) a believer in labour unions and
an opponent of the open shop, and (k) any one who would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
be looked upon with disapproval by a committee consisting of
Judge Gary, Archibald Stevenson, and Brander Matthews.</p>

<p>There is scarcely more light to be had from the radicals
themselves. Any one who feels a natural distaste for the
censorious crowd of suppressors is likely to class himself with
the free spirits whom they oppose. To call oneself a radical
is in such circumstances a necessary accompaniment of self-respect.
The content of the radicalism is of minor importance.
There is an adventurous tendency to espouse anything
that is forbidden, and so to include among one’s affirmations
the most contradictory systems—such as Nietzscheanism and
Communism, Christianity of the mystical sort and rebellion.
And when these rebels really begin to think, the confusion is
increased. Each pours his whole ardour into some exclusive
creed, which makes him scorn other earnest souls who happen
to disagree about abstruse technical points. Among economic
radicals, terms like “counter-revolutionary” and “bourgeois”
are bandied about in a most unpleasant fashion. If, for instance,
you happen to believe that Socialism may be brought
about through the ballot rather than through the general strike,
numbers of radicals will believe you more dangerous than the
Czar himself; it is certain that when the time comes you will
be found fighting on the wrong side of the barricade. Creeds
have innumerable subdivisions, and on the exact acceptance
of the creed depends your eternal salvation. Calvinists,
Wesleyans, Lutherans, and the rest in their most exigent days
could not rival the logical hair-splitting which has lately taken
place among the sectarian economic dissenters, nor has any
religious quarrel ever surpassed in bitterness the dogmatic
dissidence with which the numerous schools of authoritarian
rebellion rebel against authority.</p>

<p>There is a brilliant magazine published in New York which
takes pride in edging a little to the left of the leftmost radical,
wherever for the moment that may be. Its editor is a poet,
and he writes eloquently of the proletariat and the worker.
Not long ago I was speaking of this editor to an actual leader
of labour—a man who is a radical, and who also takes a daily
part in the workers’ struggles. “Yes,” he said, “he certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
can write. He is one of the best writers living.” And he
went on wistfully, “If the labour movement only had a writer
like that!”</p>

<p>There is another brilliant magazine published in New York
which takes exquisite pains to inform the reader that it is
radical. In precise columns of elegant type, Puritan in its
scorn of passion or sensation, it weekly derides the sentimental
liberal for ignorance of “fundamental economics.” Not long
ago it made the startling discovery that Socialists favour taking
natural resources out of private ownership. And its “fundamental
economics,” whenever they appear in language simple
enough for the common reader to understand, turn out to
be nothing more dangerous than that respectable and ancient
heresy, the single tax.</p>

<p>Another method of definition is now in common use—a
method which seems easy because of its mechanical simplicity.
People are arranged in a row from left to right, according to
their attitude toward the existing order. At the extreme right
are the reactionaries, who want to restore the discarded. Next
to them are the conservatives, who wish to keep most of what
exists. At their elbow are the liberals, who are ready to examine
new ideas, but who are not eager or dogmatic about
change. And at the extreme left are the radicals, who want
to change nearly everything for something totally new. Such
an arrangement is a confusing misuse of words based on a misconception
of social forces. Society is not a car on a track,
along which it may move in either direction, or on which it may
stand still. Society is a complex, with many of the characteristics
of an organism. Its change is continuous, although
by no means constant. It passes through long periods of
quiescence, and comparatively brief periods of rapid mutation.
It may collect itself into a close order, or again become dispersed
into a nebula. There is much in its development that
is cyclical; it has yet undiscovered rhythms, and many vagaries.
The radical and the reactionary may be agreed on essentials;
they may both wish sudden change and closer organization.
The conservative may be liberal because he wishes to preserve
an order in which liberal virtues may exist. Or a liberal may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
be so cribbed and confined by an unpleasant constriction of
social tissue that he becomes radical in his struggle for immediate
release. The terms are not of the same class and should
not be arranged in parallel columns.</p>

<p>The dictionary definition is enlightening. “Radical—Going
to the root or origin; touching or acting upon what is essential
or fundamental; thorough.... <em>Radical reform</em>, a thorough
reform.... Hence Radical Reformer equals Radical”
(New English Dictionary). In this sense radicalism is an
historic American tradition. The revolt of the Colonies
against England and the formation of the Republic were, indeed,
far from the complete break with the past which the
schoolboy assumes them to have been, but what lives in the
minds of the American people is, nevertheless, not the series
of counterchecks which men like Hamilton and Madison wrote
into the Constitution, but rather the daring affirmations of
Jefferson which have a real kinship with the radical spirit of
the French Revolution. Talk of “inalienable rights” such
as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness was genuine radical
talk; it searched out the bases of human relationship, proclaimed
them against authority, and sought to found on them a
system of government.</p>

<p>So strongly has this conception seized the imagination of
Americans that it largely accounts for their almost instinctive
hostility to new kinds of political change. The roots of politics
have been uncovered, the change has in fact been made
once for all—so they reason. To admit that any new fundamental
alteration is necessary is to be disloyal to the historical
liberation. Because the conservative American believes himself
a complete democrat, because for him the “new order”
was achieved in 1776, he is intolerant of modern radicals.
Suggestions of new revolution touch him closely on his pride.
In this sense Jefferson has been less a spur to future generations
than an obstacle. If his fine frenzy about rights had
been less eloquently expressed, if it had not obscured in a
cloud of glory the true nature of the foundation of our government—a
highly practical compromise which embodied a few
moderate advances and many hesitancies—we should have a
different temper about change to-day. We should not assume<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
that all desirable fundamental modification of social and political
structure had been completed nearly a century and a
half ago.</p>

<p>The greatest historic expression of American radicalism has
thus become the altar of the conservatives. To the unlettered
man it may seem strange that a Supreme Court of elderly
radicals will not allow Congress to forbid child-labour because
of their loyalty to an 18th-century limitation of the federal
government, presumably in the interest of freedom and humanity.
To workmen voting for the eight-hour day the language
of Jefferson did not seem hostile—they were struggling
to pursue happiness in a way that he must have approved.
And yet it is the sacred “right” of contract which deprived
them, as voters, of the right to legislate for shorter hours.
Workmen using their collective economic power to gain industrial
freedom are met by a shower of injunctive denials, based
chiefly on that same right of contract. In order to stay any
further liberation of the human body and spirit, judges and
officials and industrial barons have only to invoke the phrases
of freedom thrown out against an ancient despotism. They
have only to point out that freedom as defined abstractly over
a hundred years ago forbids practical freedom to-day. Frozen
radicalism of the past chills and destroys the new roots of
American life.</p>

<p>Some appreciation of this state of affairs underlies the prevailing
tendency to believe that all new radicalism has a foreign
origin. It is, indeed, part of the best nationalistic tradition
to attribute subversive doctrines to foreigners. This is
the habit in every country. But in the United States the habit
is perhaps more deep-seated than elsewhere. Americans are
by definition free and equal; if then any one talks or acts as
if he were not free and equal, he must have been born somewhere
else. The American Government, being not a faulty
product of human growth, but a new creation sprung perfect
out of the ineffable minds of the Fathers, is unassailable; if
any one assails it, he cannot know it, and must be subjected
to courses in English and Civics (Americanization) until he
recognizes its perfection. Treason in this country is not simple
treason to a ruler, to a class, or to a system as elsewhere; it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
is an act of sacrilege, by one uninitiated, upon a religious
mystery.</p>

<p>Of course there are and have been Americans whose radicalism
is less crust and more meat. The spirit of Jefferson
still lives, after all, to confute the interpretation put upon his
words. And imported doctrine has actually had less to do with
most of the radical movements in America than has American
tradition itself. It is an easy step from the conception of political
liberty to the conception of economic liberty, and the
step has been made here as readily as in Europe. In a country
which for so long offered extraordinary opportunities to the
individual business man, it is only natural that economic liberty
should have been conceived as a means of protecting his
enterprise; and as a matter of fact our economic legislation for
many years has been sprinkled with victories of the small
business men and farmers over the interests which had already
become large enough to seem to them oppressive. The regulation
of the railroads, the succession of popular financial doctrines,
and the anti-trust legislation, were all initiated by the
interpretation of economic democracy naturally arising in the
vigorous class of the small entrepreneurs. With the slow weakening
of this class by its disintegration, on one hand into captains
and lieutenants of the great principalities of industry,
and on the other into permanently salaried or waged members
of the rank and file, comes a corresponding tendency to change
the prevailing conception of economic democracy. The radicalism
of workmen in the United States has often been no
less sweeping or assertive than the radicalism of workmen anywhere—witness
the I.W.W. Even violence in the labour
struggle has been practised chiefly by one hundred per cent.
Americans—the steel workers in Homestead in 1892 and the
West Virginia miners in Mingo County in 1921 were of old
American stock. And the moment the predominating group
in American thought and activity is composed of those who
expect to live by their daily work rather than of those who
expect to accumulate property, we are likely to see the rise of
an economic radicalism more akin to that which exists in
Europe, and one which, because of its sanction in our tradition,
will be twice as militant and convinced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span></p>

<p>For, after all, economic radicalism arises neither from a
merely stupid desire for more material goods, nor from an intellectual
adherence to a particular formula of industrial organization.
It arises from a desire to be free, to achieve
dignity and independence. Poverty is distressful not so much
because of its physical hardships as because of its spiritual
bondage. To be poor because one chooses to be poor is less
annoying than to be moderately paid while the man who fixes
one’s wages rides in a Rolls-Royce. The most modest aspects
of the labour movement are attempts of the workmen to gain
some voice in determining the conditions under which they
must work—in other words, to extend democracy into industry.
And when the workman wakes up to the fact that industrial
policies are governed by a comparatively small class of
owners, and that the visible result of those policies seems to
be a large class of underemployed, undernourished, and under-housed
families on one hand, and a small class of abundantly
supplied families on the other, he feels that he is suffering an
indignity. You may challenge him to prove that any other
system would work better. You may argue that if all the
wealth of the rich were distributed equally, he would receive
but a trifle. Such reasoning will affect him little. If every
one must be miserable, he at least wants to share and exercise
whatever power exists to alter that misery. Kings have argued
that the people could rule no better than they, but that has not
prevented peoples from demanding representative government.
The American tradition is sure to be as subversive a motive
in industry as it has been in the State. The technical problem
of how industry may be better organized, important as it
is, is subordinate to this cry of the personality. Essentially,
this sort of radicalism arises from the instinct of the workman
to achieve an adult relationship to the industrial world.</p>

<p>The impact of the war upon industry, and the reverberation
of its social results abroad, for some time stimulated this
latent feeling in American workmen. For the first time in
decades the competition of the unemployed and the immigrant
was virtually removed, and the wage-earner began to feel secure
enough to assert his personality. He was necessary to
the community in an immediate way. The policy of the government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
was to recognize this fact, and to prevent an unduly
rapid increase in wages and in the power of organized labour
by compromising with it on certain simple issues like collective
bargaining and the eight-hour day. But larger aspirations
arose in the rank and file, and when the Russian Revolution
sent a word of emancipation around the world, they were ready
to listen. In spite of the crushing force of the whole ruling
propaganda machinery, which had been so successful in arousing
hatred against Germany, countless American workmen
sensed the approach of a new order as a result of the success
of the Bolsheviki. A secondary impulse of the same sort, felt
even more strongly in some quarters, arose from the Nottingham
programme of the British Labour Party. But affairs
moved slowly, hope was deferred, and at length the new spirit
lost much of its freshness and power. The very acrimoniousness
and volume of the controversy over what had or had not
been done in Russia wearied most people of the whole matter.
The many expected revolutions in other countries, which missed
fire so many times, caused disillusionment. The doctrinaire
and even religious adherents of the Russian Communists began
to make trouble for every radical organization in the country
by their quarrels and divisions. At length, the war being
over, the American labour movement itself began to display
a weakness in the face of renewed attack on the part of its
opponents, which showed how illusory had been many of its
recent gains and how seriously its morale had been injured.</p>

<p>Economic radicalism never looked—on the surface—weaker
than it does in the United States to-day. On the strength of
statements by Mr. Gompers and some other leaders of the
trade unions, we are likely to assume that organized labour
will have nothing to do with it. The professed radicals themselves
have been weakened by dissensions and scattered by
persecution. Yet a brief survey of the formal groups which
now profess radical theories will indicate why the future of
American radicalism should not be assessed on the evidence of
their present low estate.</p>

<p>The Socialist Party, even more than the Socialist Parties in
other countries, was placed by the war in a difficult situation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
With its roots not yet firmly in the soil, except in a few localities
and among diverse national elements, it was faced with
the necessity, in accordance with its principles and tradition,
of denouncing the entrance of the United States into hostilities.
But this decision could command no effective support from
the workers organized on the economic field, who under a
different leadership adopted a different attitude. Nor was the
party strong enough among any other element of the population
to make its decision respected. The only immediate
result of the gesture was therefore to place this unarmed little
force in the most exposed position possible, where it drew the
fire of all those who were nervously afraid the people would
not sanction the war. Socialism was not judged on the basis
of its economic tenets, but was condemned as disloyal and
pro-German; and the effect was to render the party even more
sectarian and unrepresentative than ever before. It had
adopted a position in which it could not expect recruits except
from moral heroes, and no nation nourishes a large proportion
of these. Such episodes make good legend, but they do not
lead to prompt victories. Even those who later have come to
believe that the Socialists were right about the war are likely
to express their belief in some other form than joining the
party.</p>

<p>In this weakened condition, the Socialist Party after the war
developed internal fissures. Many bitter words have been
exchanged as to whether the “Left Wingers” were or were not
a majority of the party, whether they were or were not more
orthodox than those in control of the party machinery, and
whether, if they were more orthodox, their orthodoxy was wise.
At any rate, they broke away and formed two new parties of
their own, a fact which is the chief point of interest to one
who is more concerned with the larger issues of American
radicalism than with the minutiæ of Socialist politics. The
Communist Party and the Communist Labour Party, whatever
may have been the legitimacy of their gestation in the
bowels of Socialism, certainly found their reason for being
chiefly in logic which originated in Moscow and Berlin rather
than in the American situation. At once selected for persecution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
by government officials, they burrowed underground,
doubtless followed by a band of spies at least as numerous as
they. From these subterranean regions have come rumours
of a fourth party—the United Communist, which swallowed
most of the Communist Labourites and some of the Communists.
At last accounts the Communists and the United
Communists were each attempting to prove the other counter-revolutionary
by reference to the latest documents from international
revolutionary headquarters.</p>

<p>It is hazardous in the extreme for an outsider to speak of
the differences in doctrine among these groups. It is probably
fair to say, however, that the Communist parties are chiefly
distinguished by their total lack of interest in anything save
a complete revolution, because this is the only kind they believe
possible. They reject as “compromises” partial gains
of all sorts; piecemeal progress by evolutionary methods rather
offends them than otherwise. Their eyes are turned always
toward some future revolutionary situation; for this their organization
and their theories are being prepared. This being
the case, the validity of their position will be tested by the
event. If, as the milder Socialists believe, economic changes
may come gradually by process of growth and smaller shocks,
the Communists are likely to remain a nearly functionless
and tiny minority, even in the labour movement. If, as the
Communists believe, the present order in the normal course of
its development is destined to experience a sudden collapse
similar to that which occurred in Russia near the end of the
war, they will become the true prophets, and their mode of
thought and action will presumably have fitted them to assume
leadership.</p>

<p>The Farmer-Labour Party is a recent growth far less doctrinaire
than either the Socialist or the Communist groups.
It has neither prophet nor Bible, but is based rather on the
principle of gathering certain categories of people together for
political action, trusting that as they become organized they
will work out their own programme in relation to the situation,
and that that programme will develop as time goes on. The
categories to which it appeals are chiefly the industrial workers
and the small farmers, who have in general common economic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
interests as opposed to the large owners of land and
capital. It hopes that other elements in the population, realizing
that their major interests are much the same as those
of the unionists and the farmers, will join forces with them
to produce a majority. As an illustration of the operation of
such tactics, the Farmer-Labourites point to the success of the
Independent Labour Party of Great Britain, first in aiding the
foundation of the British Labour Party, and second in building
up for that party an increasingly coherent radical programme.</p>

<p>In all these cases, however, not much confidence is placed in
the actual political machinery of elections. There is a widespread
scepticism about the ability to accomplish industrial
changes by the ballot, on account of experience with political
corruption, broken election promises, adverse court decisions,
and political buncombe in general. These parties are formed as
much for the purpose of propagating ideas and creating centres
of activity as for mobilizing votes. All radical parties lay
great stress on the industrial power of the organized labour
movement. This is not to say that they do not recognize the
importance of the State in industrial matters. All agree that
control of political machinery will in the long run be necessary,
if only to prevent it from checking the advance of the people
through the courts and police. But they also agree that control
of the State is not held and cannot be attained by political
machinery alone. The present influence of the proprietors
of industry on politics is due, they see, chiefly to economic
power, and the workers consequently must not neglect
the development of their own economic organization. The
Communists are completely hopeless of attaining results
through the present election machinery; the Socialists and
Farmer-Labourites believe it possible to secure a majority at
the polls, which may then execute its will, if the workers are
well enough organized for industrial action.</p>

<p>Outwardly the most successful of the radical movements is
the least doctrinaire of all. It is unnecessary to repeat the
history and achievements of the Nonpartisan League—an attempt
on the part of organized farmers to use the machinery
of the State in order to gain economic independence from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
banking, milling, and packing interests. Other groups of
farmers have aimed at a similar result through co-operation,
with varying success.</p>

<p>In the industrial labour movement proper there have been
numerous radical minorities. The most uncompromising of
these, as well as the most characteristically American, was the
Industrial Workers of the World, who aspired to build up a
consciously revolutionary body to rival the unions composing
the American Federation of Labour. This decline is due not
so much to suppression as to their previous failure to enlist the
continued support of the industrial workers themselves. Like
the Communists, the I.W.W. predicated their success on a revolutionary
situation, and lacking that situation they could not
build a labour movement on an abstract idea. Over long
periods not enough people are moved by a philosophy of salvation
to give staying power to such an organization in the
daily struggle with the employers. Other similar attempts,
such as the W.I.I.U., and the more recent One Big Union,
have encountered similar difficulties. They grow rapidly in
crises, but fail under the strain of continued performance.</p>

<p>The failure of American radicals to build up a strong movement
is in part due, of course, to the natural difficulties of the
social and economic situation, but it is also due to the mental
traits which usually accompany remoteness from reality. This
is illustrated in the history of the I.W.W., if we accept William
Z. Foster’s acute analysis. The regular trade-union movement,
slowly evolving towards a goal but half consciously
realized, overcoming practical obstacles painfully and clumsily,
as such obstacles usually are overcome, was too halting for
these impatient radicals. They withdrew, and set up rival,
perfectionist unions, founded in uncompromising revolutionary
ardour. These organizations were often unable to serve the
rank and file in their practical difficulties, and consequently
could not supplant the historic labour movement. But they
did draw out of that movement many of its most sincere and
ardent spirits, thus depriving it of the ferment which was
necessary to its growth. The I.W.W., for their part, failing
to secure any large grip on reality, regressed into quarrels
about theory, suffered divisions of their social personality, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
at length—except in the far West—became little more than
economic anchorites. As Foster says, “The I.W.W. were
absolutely against results.”</p>

<p>Too much of American radicalism has been diverted to
the easy emotional satisfaction which is substituted for the
arduous process of dealing with reality. We suffer a restriction
of the personality, we cry out against the oppressor, we
invent slogans and doctrines, we fill our minds with day dreams,
with intricate mechanisms of some imaginary revolution. At
the same time we withdraw from the actual next step. Here
is the trade-union movement, built up painfully for over a century,
a great army with many divisions which function every
day in the industrial struggle. How many radicals know it
in any detail? How many have paid the slightest attention to
the technique of its organization, or have devoted any time to
a working out of the smaller problems which must be worked
out before it can achieve this or that victory? Here are our
great industries, our complex systems of exchange. How many
radicals really know the technique of even the smallest section
of them? Radicals wish to reorganize the industrial system;
would they know how to organize a factory?</p>

<p>If radicalism arises from the instinct for economic maturity,
then it can find its place in the world only by learning its function,
only by expressing its emotion in terms of the actual with
which it has to deal. A period of adolescence was to be expected,
but to prolong the characteristics of that period is to
invite futility. And as a matter of fact American radicalism
now exhibits a tendency to establish more contacts with reality.
Instead of withdrawing from established unions to start
a new and spotless labour movement, radicals are beginning
to visualize and to carry out the difficult but possible task of
improving the organization of the existing unions, and of charging
them with new energy and ideas. Unions which were
founded by radicals—such as the Amalgamated Clothing Workers
of America—are devoting their efforts not to talking of a
future revolution, but to organizing the workers more firmly
in the present, to establishing constitutional government in
industry through which tangible advances may be made and
safeguarded, and to improving the productivity of industry itself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
Engineers, encouraged by labour organizations, and in
some cases actually paid by them, are investigating the problem
of economic waste, and are demonstrating by line upon
line and precept upon precept how the chaos of competition,
industrial autocracy, and a controlling profit motive are reflected
in idle hours, low wages, high prices, and inferior products.
The co-operative movement is slowly providing a new
and more efficient machinery of distribution, while co-operative
banks are building up a reserve of credit for those who wish
to experiment with undertakings conducted for other purposes
than the profit of the proprietor. Such functional use of the
labour movement is more dangerous to the existing disorder
than volumes of phrases or a whole battalion of “natural
rights.”</p>

<p>Extremists call such activities compromise. They are compromise
in the sense that any hypothesis must be changed to
fit the facts, but they involve no compromise with scientific
truth. The alchemist compromised when he gave up the
search for the philosopher’s stone and began to learn from the
elements. He surrendered a sterile dogma for a fruitful science.
In proportion as radicals learn how to put their emotions
to work, in proportion as they devise ways to function
in the world in which we live, will they make possible not only
unity among themselves, but a rapprochement with other
Americans. A man who believes there is no real possibility
of change short of complete revolution can unite with a man
who has no theory about the matter at all so long as they do
not discuss abstract doctrine, but concentrate upon the problem
of how to bring about a particular effect at a particular
time. The most radical theories, if expressed in terms of concrete
situations, will be accepted by those who are wary of
generalities, or do not understand them. The theories will be
tested in the fact. The operation of such a process may be
blocked by those who dogmatically oppose all experiment, but
in that case the forces of reason and of nature will be so clearly
on the side of the radical that there can be no doubt about
his ultimate fruitfulness.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">America</span> is a nation of villagers, once remarked George
Bernard Shaw in a moment of his most exclusive scorn
for what he believed was our crude and naïve susceptibility to
the modes and moods, to say nothing of the manners, of the
professional patriots during that hectic period when Wilhelm
was training to become the woodman of Amerongen. Now
Shaw is the oracle of the Occident, and when he speaks there
is no docile dog this side of Adelphi Terrace presumptuous
enough to bark. At least there should not be; and in any
event, neither history nor H. G. Wells records any spirited
protest on America’s part to the Shavian accusation. It was
allowed to stand invulnerable and irrefutable. Of course, in
our hearts we know Shaw is right. We may for the moment
be signifying <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">rus in urbe</i>, but between you and me and the
chief copy-reader of the Marion (Ohio) <cite>Star</cite>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in urbe</i> is a superfluous
detail.</p>

<p>Show me a native New Yorker and I will show you something
as extinct as a bar-tender. There are no native New
Yorkers. All New Yorkers come from small towns and farms.
Ask Dad, ask the Sunday editor, ask the census-taker—they
know. And what is true of New York is true of Boston and
Chicago. The big men, the notable men of the big cities, hail
from the small towns, the Springfields, the Jacksons, the Jamestowns,
Georgetowns, Charlestowns—yes, and from the Elizabeths
and Charlottes—of the nation.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances any back-to-the-land movement in
this country seems futile if not ridiculous. The land is still
confident and capable of taking care of itself. It needs no aid
from the city chaps and asks none. The Freudians are not
deceived for a moment over the basis of a return-to-the-farm
enterprise. They recognize it for what it is—a sentimental
complex superinduced by the nervous hysteria of the city. But
even the amazingly small proportion of the population that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
not Freudian refuses to become influenced by the cry of the
sentimentalists. Because it is keenly, though unpretentiously,
aware of the genuinely rural state of its culture and civilization.</p>

<p>The civilization of America is predominantly the civilization
of the small town. The few libertarians and cosmopolites who
continue to profess to see a broader culture developing along
the Atlantic seaboard resent this fact, though they scarcely
deny it. They are too intelligent, too widened in vision to
deny it. They cannot watch the tremendous growth and
power and influence of secret societies, of chambers of commerce,
of boosters’ clubs, of the Ford car, of moving pictures,
of talking-machines, of evangelists, of nerve tonics, of the <cite>Saturday
Evening Post</cite>, of Browning societies, of circuses, of
church socials, of parades and pageants of every kind and
description, of family reunions, of pioneer picnics, of county
fairs, of firemen’s conventions without secretly acknowledging
it. And they know, if they have obtained a true perspective
of America, that there is no section of this vast political unit
that does not possess—and even frequently boast—these unmistakably
provincial signs and symbols.</p>

<p>I do not mean to imply that such aspects make America an
unfit place in which to live. On the contrary, America’s very
possession of them brings colour and rugged picturesqueness,
if not a little pathos, to the individual with imagination sufficient
to find them. Mr. Dreiser found them and shed a triumphant
tear. “Dear, crude America” is to him a sweet and
melancholy reality. It is a reality that has been expressed with
a good deal of prophecy—and some profit—by the young novelists.
Small-town realism with a vengeance, rather than a joy,
has been the keynote of their remarkable success during the
past year. However, they pulled the pendulum of cultural life
too far in one direction. They failed, for the most part, of
appreciating the similarity of human nature in city as in country,
with the result that their triumph is ephemeral. Already
the reaction has set in. There are now going on in the work-rooms
of the novelists attempts to immortalize Riverside Drive,
Fifth Avenue, Beacon Street, Michigan Boulevard, and Pennsylvania
Avenue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span></p>

<p>Unless they penetrate into the soul of these avenues, unless
they perceive that these avenues are not spiritually different
from Main Street, though they may be clothed in the
habiliments of metropolitan taste and fancy, they will fail to
symbolize correctly America. They will be writing merely for
money and controversial space in the literary supplements.</p>

<p>For the soul of these avenues is a soul with an <em>i</em> substituted
for <em>u</em>. It is the soul of the land. It is a homely, wholesome
provincialism, typifying human nature as it is found
throughout the United States. We may herd in a large centre
of population, assume the superficialities of cosmopolitan culture
and genuinely believe ourselves devils of fellows. It takes
all the force of a prohibition law to make us realize that we are
more sinned against than sinning. Then are we confronted
sharply by the fact that the herd is appallingly inefficient and
inarticulate in a conflict with isolated individualism.</p>

<p>The prohibition movement originated in farming communities
and villages where the evils of alcohol are ridiculously insignificant.
No self-respecting or neighbour-respecting villager
could afford to be known as a drinking man. His business or
his livelihood was at stake. Then why did he foster prohibition?
Why did he seek to fasten it upon the city resident
who, if he drank, did not lose apparently his own or his neighbour’s
respect? Chiefly because of his very isolation. Because
he was geographically deprived of the enjoyments which the
city man shared. I can well imagine a farmer in the long
sweating hours of harvest time or a small town storekeeper
forced to currying favour with his friends and neighbours 365
days in a year, resolutely declaring that what he cannot have
the man in the city shall not have. The hatching of all kinds
of prohibitory plots can be traced to just such apparent injustices
of life. Dr. Freud would correctly explain it under the
heading of inferiority-complex.</p>

<p>City men have marvelled at the remarkable organization of
the reformers. It is not so much organization, however, as it
is a national feeling perceived and expressed simultaneously.
Cities may conduct the most efficient propaganda against such
a feeling, they may assemble their largest voting strength to
assail it. All in vain. The country districts roll up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
majorities and the cities are left unmistakably high and dry.</p>

<p>So it is with most of the laws and movements of America.
The rural sections have but to will them and they become
in due time established facts. An idea merely has to take
root in the mind of some socially oppressed individual. He
talks it over with his friends at lodge meeting or during an
informal hour at a board of trade meeting. He receives encouragement.
He imparts the idea to his wife, who carries it
to her literary club, where it is given further airing. It spreads
to the volunteer firemen’s clubrooms, to the grange picnics
and the church socials. It is discussed in the pulpits. Finally
it reaches the ears of the village and county politicians who,
impressed by its appeal to the moral force of the community,
decide after hours in the back room of the post-office or the
national bank to interest the congressman or assemblyman
from their district in its merits as a possible law upon the
statute books. The congressman and assemblyman, acutely
aware of the side on which their bread is buttered, agree to do
“everything within their power” to put the measure through.
Having the assistance of other congressmen and assemblymen,
most of whom are from rural districts, their tasks assuredly
are not difficult.</p>

<p>Before the appearance of the automobile and the movie
upon the national horizon, the small town was chiefly characterized
by a distinctly rural and often melancholy peacefulness.
A gentle air of depression hung over it, destructive of the ambitious
spirit of youth and yet, by very reason of its existence,
influencing this spirit to seek adventure and livelihood in wider
fields. Amusements were few and far between. It was the day
of the quilting party, of the Sunday promenade in the cemetery,
of buggy-riding, of the ice-cream festival and the spelling
bee. The bucolic note was ever present.</p>

<p>Such an environment, while joyous to the small boy, became
hopelessly dull and lifeless to the youth of vitality and imagination.
Restlessness with it tormented him day and night until
it grew into an obsession. Especially did he dislike Sunday,
its funereal quiet with stores closed and other possible avenues
of excitement and adventure forbidden. He began to cherish
dreams of a life strange and teeming in distant cities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span></p>

<p>As he grew older and a measure of independence came to
him he fled, provided there was no business established by a
patient and hard-working ancestry which might lure him into
remaining home. And even that did not always attract him.
He was compelled to go by his very nature—a nature that desired
a change from the pall of confining and circumscribed
realism, the masks of respectability everywhere about him, the
ridiculous display of caste, that saw a rainbow of fulfilled ideals
over the hills, that demanded, in a word, romance.</p>

<p>He, who did not feel this urge, departed because of lack of
business opportunities. Occasionally he returned disillusioned
and exhausted by the city and eager to re-establish himself in
a line of work which promised spiritual contentment. But
more often he stayed away, struggling with the crowd in the
city, returning home only for short vacation periods for rest
and reminiscence, to see his people and renew boyhood friendships.
At such times he was likely to be impressed by the
seeming prosperity of those boys he left behind, of the apparent
enjoyment they found in the narrow environment. The
thought may have occurred to him that the life of the small
town had undergone a marked change, that it had adopted
awkward, self-conscious urban airs.</p>

<p>Suddenly he realizes that the automobile and the movie
and to some extent the topical magazine are mainly responsible
for the contrast. The motor-car has given the small town
man an ever-increasing contact with the city, with life at formerly
inaccessible resorts, with the country at large. And the
movie and the magazine have brought him news and pictures
of the outside world. He has patronized them and grown
wiser.</p>

<p>The basis, the underlying motive, of all cultural life in the
small town is social. The intellectual never enters. It may
try to get in but the doors are usually barred. There is
practically no demand for the so-called intellectual magazines.
Therefore, they are seldom placed on sale. But few daily
papers outside of a radius of fifty miles are read. Plays which
have exclusive appeal to the imagination or the intellect are
presented to rows of empty seats. On the other hand, dramas
teeming with primitive emotions and the familiar devices of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
hokum attract large audiences, provided the producing managers
care to abide by the present excessive transportation
rates. There is but little interest manifested in great world
movements, such as the economic upheaval in Eastern Europe.
Normalcy is, indeed, the watchword so far as intellectual development
is concerned.</p>

<p>It is in the social atmosphere that the American village has
its real <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">raison d’être</i>. Therein do we meet the characteristics
that have stamped themselves indelibly upon American life.
The thousand and one secret societies that flourish here have
particularly fertile soil in the small towns. Count all the loyal
legionaries of all the chapters of all the secret societies between
the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and you have a job suited only
to the most irrepressible statistician. And the most loyal live
in the small towns and villages of the United States. The
choice is not limited. There are societies enough to suit all
kinds of personalities and purses.</p>

<p>The Knights of Pythias, the Knights of the Maccabees, the
Odd Fellows, the Elks, the Eagles, the Loyal Order of the
Moose, the Modern Woodmen, the Masons with their elaborate
subdivisions of Shriners and Knights Templar—all count
their membership throughout the nation. And the women,
jealous of their husbands’ loyalty to various and complex forms
of hocus-pocus, have organized auxiliary societies which, while
not maintaining the secrecy that veils the fraternal orders,
nevertheless build up a pretentious mystery intriguing to the
male mind.</p>

<p>No town is a self-respecting town unless it can boast half
a dozen of these societies. They are the fabric of which the
basis of the social structure is built. They are the very essence
of America. They dot the national landscape. Every city, as
if to prove conclusively its provincial nature, displays one or
more temples devoted to the rituals of fraternal organization.</p>

<p>Recently the South has revived the order of the Ku Klux
Klan which flourished after the Civil War as a means of improving
upon the orderly course of the law in dealing with the
Negro race. Here is the apotheosis of the secret society, with
its magnificent concealment of identity in a unique form of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
dress, its pretensions to 100 per cent. Americanism, its blatant
proclamations of perpetuating the great and glorious traditions
of the republic. The Negro has already organized to offset
this propaganda. He knew that unless he could show secret
orders of imposing strength he had no right even to the questionable
heritage of habitation here. He would be outside the
spirit of the times. He owed it to America, to “dear, crude
America,” to organize lodges and secret societies; and he has
done so.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the secret society plays a large part in the
greatness of America. It has made the American class-conscious.
It has made him recognize his own importance, his
own right to the national distinction of good-fellowship. It
provides him temporary surcease from domestic and business
details, though there are countless numbers of men who join
these orders to make business details, so far as they affect
them, more significant.</p>

<p>The amazing prevalence of conventions in America is an
outgrowth of the secret societies. Life to many 100 per cent.
Americans is just one lodge convention after another. Held
in a different city each year, a distinction that is industriously
competed for, the convention has become a fixed fact in American
cultural life. Here is the one occasion of the year when
the serious diddle-daddle is laid aside, and refuge and freedom
are sought in such amusements as the convention city can
offer. The secret order convention has inspired the assembly
of all kinds and descriptions of conventions—trade conventions,
religious conventions, educational conventions—until
there is no city in the land boasting a first-class hotel that does
not at one time or another during the year house delegates with
elaborate insignia and badges.</p>

<p>Probably the first parade held in America was that of a
class-conscious fraternal organization eager to display its high
standard of membership as well as a unique resplendence in
elaborate regalia. The parade has continued an integral part
of American life ever since. There is something of the vigour,
the gusto and crudeness of America in a parade. It has come
to represent life here in all its curious phases.</p>

<p>The parade had become an event of colourful significance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
when P. T. Barnum organized the “greatest show on earth.”
He decided to glorify it—in his dictionary “to glorify” really
meant “to commercialize”—and once and for all time associate
it chiefly with the circus. He succeeded, mainly because
the residents of the villages were receptive to the idea. They
saw a bizarre relief from the monotony of existence. The
farmers rolled down from the hills in their lumber-wagons
and found an inarticulate joy, storekeepers closed shop and
experienced a tumultuous freedom from the petty bickerings
of trade, men and women renewed their youth, children were
suddenly thrown into a very ecstasy of delight. Thus, the
circus parade became part and parcel of American civilization.</p>

<p>And the precious and unique spirit created by the circus
parade has been carried on in innumerable representations.
To-day America shelters parades of every conceivable enterprise.
Firemen have a day in every small town of the land on
which they joyously pull flower-laden hose-carts for the entertainment
of their fellow-citizens. Bearing such labels as
Alerts, Rescues and Champion Hook and Ladder No. 1, they
march proudly down Main Street—and the world goes hang.
The volunteer firemen’s organization is an institution peculiar
to the American small town,—an institution, too, that is not
without class-consciousness. The rough-and-ready, comparatively
illiterate young men form one group. The clerks, men
engaged in the professions and social favourites compose another.
This class is usually endowed by the wealthiest resident
of the town, and its gratitude is expressed usually by naming
the organization for the local Crœsus.</p>

<p>The Elks parade, the Knights of Pythias parade, veterans
of various wars parade, the Shriners and Knights Templar
parade, prohibitionists parade, anti-prohibitionists parade, politicians
parade, women parade, babies parade—everybody
parades in America. Indeed, America can be divided into
two classes, those who parade and those who watch the parade.
The parade is indelibly identified with the small town. It is
also inalienably associated with the large city, composed, as it
is, of small-town men.</p>

<p>There has lately taken place in the villages throughout
the country a new movement that has civic pride as its basis.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
It is the formation of boosters’ clubs. Everybody is boosting
his home town, at least publicly, though in the privacy
of the front porch he may be justly depressed by its narrowness
of opportunity, its subservience to social snobbery, its
intellectual aridity. “Come to Our Town. Free Sites Furnished
for Factories,” read the signs along the railroad tracks.
“Boost Our Town” shout banners stretched across Main
Street.</p>

<p>Is there not something vitally poignant in such a proud provincialism?
Is not America endeavouring to lift itself up by
its boot-straps, to make life more comfortable and interesting?
The groping, though crude, is commendable. It is badly directed
because there is no inspiration back of it, because its
organizers are only remotely aware how to make life here more
interesting. However, there is the effort and it is welcome.</p>

<p>Perhaps, when the towns—and for that matter the cities—realize
that artistic sensitiveness is necessary to achieve comfort
and interest we shall have boosters who are as enthusiastic
on the front porch as in the board of trade meeting. When
will our towns take artistic advantage of their river-fronts?
The place for the most beautiful walk and drive and park presents
usually unsightly piers, factories and sheds. Railroad
tracks are often laid in the very heart of the town. For many
years the leading hotels in practically all of our towns and
cities were built in close proximity to the railroad station. In
seeking to save a traveller time and convenience hotel proprietors
subjected him to the bodily and mental discomforts
that are related to the vicinity of a railroad station. Of late
there is a marked tendency to erect hotels in quiet residential
streets away from the noise and confusion of shops and railroad
yards.</p>

<p>The billboard menace, while diminishing, is still imposing.
It is to the everlasting shame of the towns and cities that in
an era of prohibitions no legislative effort has been made to
stop the evil of desecrating our finest streets with advertising
signs. Such commercial greed is inconceivable to the foreign
visitor. It is one of his first impressions, though he charitably
takes refuge in public in attributing it to the high tension of
our existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span></p>

<p>While the first symptoms of artistic appreciation are beginning
to be faintly discerned upon the American horizon, the
old and familiar phases of social life in the country are still
being observed. The picnic of first settlers, the family reunion,
the church supper, the sewing circle, the Browning society—all
have national expression. The introduction of such modern
industrial devices as the automobile has not affected them
in the least. It can truly be asserted that the flivver has even
added to their popularity. It has brought people of the country
districts into closer contact than ever before. It has given
a new prestige to the picnics and the reunions.</p>

<p>What offers more rustic charm and simplicity than a family
reunion? Practically every family in the farming districts
that claims an ancestral residence in this country of more than
fifty years holds one annually. It is attended by the great
and the near-great from the cities, by the unaffected relatives
back home. Babies jostle great-grandparents. Large and
perspiring women bake for days the cakes and pies to be consumed.
The men of the house are foolishly helping in making
the rooms and the front lawn ready. At last the reunion is
at hand—a sentimental debauch, a grand gorging. Everybody
present feels the poignancy of age. But while the heart throbs
the stomach is working overtime. The law of compensation is
satisfied. “A good time was had by all” finds another expression
in the weekly paper, and the reunion becomes a
memory.</p>

<p>At pioneer picnics one finds the family reunion on a larger
scale. The whole township and county has for the time become
related. It is the day of days, a sentimental tournament
with handshaking as the most popular pastime. Organized
in the rugged primitiveness of the early part of the 19th
century by men who were first to settle in the vicinity, the
pioneer picnic has been perpetuated, until to-day it is linked
inalterably with America’s development. It has weathered
the passing of the nation from an agricultural to a great industrial
commonwealth. It has stood the gaff of time. And so
it goes on for ever, a tradition of the small town and the farming
community. While it has been divested almost entirely
of its original purpose, it serves to bring the politicians in touch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
with the “peepul.” Grandiloquent promises are made for a
day from the rostrum by a battalion of “Honourables”—and
forgotten both by the “Honourables” and the public intent
upon dancing and walking aimlessly about the grounds. The
politicians smile as they continue to preserve their heroic pose,
and the “peepul,” satisfied that all is well with the world, turn
to various gambling devices that operate under the hypocritical
eye of the sheriff and to the strange dances that have crept
up from the jungle, for it is a day filled with the eternal spirit
of youth. There is ingenuous appeal in the fair samples of
the yokelry present. There is a quiet force beneath the bovine
expressions of the boys. The soul of America—an America
glad to be alive—is being wonderfully and pathetically manifested.
No shams, no superficialities, no self-conscious sophistication
are met. Merely the sturdy quality of the true American
civilization, picturesque and haunting in its primitiveness.</p>

<p>The county fair belongs in the same classification as the first-settler
picnic. It is the annual relaxation by farmers and
merchants from the tedious tasks of seeing and talking to the
same people day after day. It offers them a measure of
equality with the people in the city with their excursion boats,
their baseball games, their park sports. And they make the
most of their opportunity. They come to see and to be seen,
to risk a few dollars on a horse race, to admire the free exhibitions
in front of the side-shows, to watch with wide eyes the
acrobatic stunts before the grandstand; to hear the “Poet and
the Peasant” overture by the band, proud and serious in a
stand of its own.</p>

<p>Three or four days given to such pleasures naturally bestow
a fine sense of illusion upon the visitors. They begin to believe
that life has been specially ordered for them. They see
through a glass lightly. They care not a whiff about the
crowded excitements of the city. They have something infinitely
more enjoyable than a professional baseball game or an
excursion ride down the river. They have days of endless
variety, of new adventures, of new thoughts. They, too, know
that America cannot go wrong so long as they continue to find
illusion. And they are correct. They may not suspect that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
American culture is crude. They do know, however, that it
is dear. They should worry.</p>

<p>Against such a background have the flavour and essence
of American life been compounded. Their influence has extended
in all directions, in all walks of industry. They have
left their impress upon the character of the country, upon the
mob and the individual. Sentimental attachment to the old
ties, to boyhood ideals and traditions remains potent though
a little concealed by the mask, be it affected or real, of sophistication.
It is the voice of a new land, of a vigorous and curious
nationalism that is being exerted. There obviously cannot
be among such a naturally healthy people a supercilious contempt
for sentiment. We may laugh a little haughtily at the
amazing susceptibility of folks to the extravagant eloquence
of itinerant evangelists. We may look on an “old home
week” with a touch of urban disdain. We may listen to the
band concert on a Saturday night in the Court House Square
with a studied indifference. We may assume an attractive
weariness in watching the promenaders on Main Street visit
one ice-cream emporium after another. But deep down in our
hearts is a feeling of invincible pride in the charming homeliness,
the youthful vitality, the fine simplicity, yes, and the
sweeping pathos of these aspects of small-town civilization.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> burghers of Holland, being (like the Chinese) inclined
towards a certain conservatism of both manners and
habits, continued the tradition of the “front parlour”—the
so-called “good-room”—well into the 20th century.
Every farmer had his “front parlour” filled with stuffy air,
stuffy furniture, and an engraving of the Eiffel Tower facing
the lithographic representation of a lady in mid-seas clinging
desperately to a somewhat ramshackle granite cross.</p>

<p>But the custom was not restricted to the bucolic districts.
His late Majesty, William III (whose funeral was the most
useful event of his long life), had been married to an estimable
lady of Victorian proclivities, who loved a “tidy” and an
“antimacassar” better than life itself. An aristocracy, recruited
from the descendants of East India Directors and West
India sugar planters, followed the Royal Example. They
owned modest homes which the more imaginative Latin would
have called “Palazzi.” Most of the ground floor was taken
up by an immense “front parlour.” For the greater part of
the year it was kept under lock and key while the family clustered
around the oil lamp of the “back parlour” where they
lived in the happy cacophony of young daughters practising
Czerny and young sons trying to master the intricacies of
“paideuo—paideueis—paideuei.”</p>

<p>As for the “front parlour” (which will form the main part
of my text), it was opened once or twice a twelve-month for
high family functions. A week beforehand, the cleaning
woman (who received six cents per hour in those blessed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
Neanderthal days) would arrive with many mops and many
brooms. The covers would be removed from the antique furniture,
the frames of the pictures would be duly scrubbed. The
carpets were submitted to a process which resembled indoor
ploughing and for fully half an hour each afternoon the windows
were opened to the extent of three or four inches.</p>

<p>Then came the day of the reception—the birthday party of
the grandfather—the betrothal of the young daughter. All
the relatives were there in their best silks and satins. The
guests were there in ditto. There was light and there was
music. There was enough food and drink to keep an entire
Chinese province from starving. Yet the party was a failure.
The old family portraits—excellent pieces by Rembrandt or
Terborch—looked down upon grandchildren whom they did
not know. The grandchildren, on the other hand, were quite
uncomfortable in the presence of this past glory. Sometimes,
when the guests had expressed a sincere admiration of these
works of art, they hired a hungry Ph.D. to write a critical essay
upon their collection for the benefit of the “Studio” or the
“Connoisseur.” Then they ordered a hundred copies, which
they sent to their friends that they might admire (and perhaps
envy) the ancient lineage of their neighbours. Thereafter,
darkness and denim covers and oblivion.</p>

<p>The history of our great Republic suffers from a fate similar
to that of these heirlooms. It lives in the “front parlour”
of the national consciousness. It is brought out upon a few
grand occasions when it merely adds to the general discomfort
of the assisting multitude. For the rest of the time it lies
forgotten in the half dark of those Washington cellars which
for lack of National Archives serve as a receptacle for the
written record of our past.</p>

<p>Our popular estimate of history and the value of a general
historical background was defined a few years ago by Henry
Ford. Mr. Ford, having made a dozen flivvers go where none
went before and having gained untold wealth out of the motor-car
industry, had been appointed an ex-officio and highly esteemed
member of our national Council of Wise Men. His
opinion was eagerly asked upon such subjects as child-raising,
irrigation, the future of the human race, and the plausibility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
of the Einstein theory. During a now memorable trial the
subject of history came up for discussion, and Mr. Ford (if
we are to believe the newspaper accounts) delivered himself
of the heartfelt sentiment that “history is bunk.” A grateful
country sang Amen!</p>

<p>When asked to elucidate this regrettable expression of dislike,
the average citizen will fall back upon reminiscences of
his early childhood and in terms both contrite and unflattering
he will thereupon describe the hours of misery which he has
spent reciting “dreary facts about useless kings,” winding up
with a wholesale denunciation of American history as something
dull beyond words.</p>

<p>We cannot say much in favour of late Stuarts, Romanoffs,
and Wasa’s, but we confess to a sincere affection for the history
of these United States. It is true there are few women
in it and no little children. This, to us, seems an advantage.
“Famous women of history” usually meant “infamous trouble”
for their much perturbed contemporaries. As for the
ever-popular children motif, the little princes of the Tower
would have given a great deal had they been allowed to whitewash
part of Tom Sawyer’s famous fence, instead of waiting in
silken splendour for Uncle Richard’s murder squad.</p>

<p>No, the trouble is not with the history of this land of endless
plains and a limitless sky. The difficulty lies with the
reader. He is the victim of an unfortunate circumstance.
The Muses did not reach these shores in the first-class cabin of
the <i>Aquitania</i>. They were almost held up at Ellis Island and
deported because they did not have the necessary fifty dollars.
They were allowed to sneak in after they had given a solemn
promise that they would try to become self-supporting and
would turn their white hands to something useful.</p>

<p>Clio, our revered mistress, has tried hard to live up to this
vow. But she simply is not that sort of woman. An excellent
counsellor, the most charming and trusted of friends, she has
absolutely no gift for the practical sides of life. She was
forced to open a little gift-shop where she sold flags and bunting
and pictures of Pocahontas and Paul Revere. The venture
was not a success. A few people took pity on her and tried
to help. She was asked to recite poetry at patriotic gatherings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
and do selections from the “Founding Fathers.” She did not
like this, being a person of shy and unassuming character. And
so she is back in the little shop. When last I saw her, she was
trying to learn the Russian alphabet. That is always a dangerous
sign.</p>

<p>And now, lest we continue to jumble our metaphors, let us
state the case with no more prejudice than is strictly necessary.</p>

<p>The earliest settlers of this country brought their history
with them. Little Snorri, son of Gudrid and Thorfinn Karlsefni,
playing amidst the vines of his father’s Labradorian garden,
undoubtedly listened to the selfsame sagas that were being
told at the court of good King Olaf Tryggvason in distant
Norway. The children of San Domingo shared the glories of
the Cid with the boys and girls who visited the schools of
Moukkadir’s ancient capital. And the long-suffering infants
of the early New England villages merely finished an historical
education that had begun at Scrooby and had been continued
at No. 21 of the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kloksteeg</i> in Leyden.</p>

<p>During the 17th century, the greater part of the Atlantic
coast became English. The Dutch and the French, the Spanish
and Swedish traditions disappeared. The history of the
British Kingdom became the universal history of the territory
situated between the thirtieth and the fiftieth degree of
latitude. Even the American Revolution was a quarrel between
two conflicting versions of certain identical principles
of history. Lord North and George Washington had learned
their lessons from the same text-book. His Lordship, of
course, never cut the pages that told of Runymede, and George
undoubtedly covered the printed sheets which told of the fate
of rebels with strange geometrical figures. But the historical
inheritance of the men who fought on the left bank of the Fish
Kill and those who surrendered on the right shore was a common
one, and Burgoyne and Gates might have spent a profitable
evening sharing a bottle of rum and complimenting each
other upon the glorious deeds of their respective but identical
ancestors.</p>

<p>But during the ’twenties and ’thirties of the 19th century, the
men of the “old régime”—the founder and fighters of the
young Republic—descended into the grave and they took their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
traditions, their hopes, and their beliefs with them. The curtain
rose upon a new time and upon a new people. The acquisition
of the Northwestern Territory in 1787 and the purchase
of Napoleon’s American real-estate in the year 1803 had
changed a little commonwealth of struggling Colonies into a
vast empire of endless plains and unlimited forests. It was
necessary to populate this new land. The history of the
Coast came to an end. The history of the Frontier began.
English traditions rarely crossed the Alleghanies. The long
struggle for representative government took on a new aspect in
a land where no king had ever set foot and where man was
sovereign by the good right of his own energy.</p>

<p>It is true that the first fifty years of the last century witnessed
the arrival upon these shores of millions of men and
women from Europe who had enjoyed a grammar school education
in the land of their birth. But dukes do not emigrate.
Those sturdy fellows who risked the terrors and horrors of the
Atlantic in the leaky tubs of the early forties came to the
country of their future that they might forget the nightmare
of the past. That nightmare included the biography of Might
which was then the main feature of the European text-book.
They threw it overboard as soon as they were well outside of
the mouth of the Elbe or the Mersey. Settled upon the farms
of Michigan and Wisconsin, they sometimes taught their children
the songs of the old Fatherland but its history never.
After two generations, this migration—the greatest of all
“treks” since the 4th century—came to an end. Roads had
been made, canals had been dug, railroads had been constructed,
forests had been turned into pastures, the Indian was
gone, the buffalo was gone, free land was gone, cities had been
built, and the scene had been made ready for the final
apotheosis of all human accomplishment—civilization.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster has ever followed in the wake of the full
dinner-pail. He now made his appearance and began to teach.
Considering the circumstances he did remarkably well. But
he too worked under a disadvantage. He was obliged to go
to New England for his learning and for his text-books. And
the historian of the Boston school, while industrious and patient,
was not entirely a fair witness. The recollection of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
British red-coats drilling on the Common was still fresh in
the minds of many good citizens. The wickedness of George
III was more than a myth to those good men and women whose
own fathers had watched Major Pitcairn as he marched forth
to arrest Adams and Hancock. They sincerely hated their
former rulers, while they could not deny their love for the old
mother country. Hence there arose a conflict of grave consequence.
With one hand the New England chronicler twisted
the tail of the British lion. With the other he fed the creature
little bits of sugar.</p>

<p>Again the scene changed. The little red school-house had
marched across the plains. It had followed the pioneer through
the passes of the Rocky Mountains. It had reached the shores
of the Pacific Ocean. The time of hacking and building and
frying with lard came to a definite end. The little red school-house
gave way for the academy of learning. College and University
arose wherever a thousand people happened to be together.
History became a part of the curriculum. The schoolmaster,
jack of all learned trades and master of many practical
pursuits, became extinct. The professional historian made
his appearance. And thereby hangs a sad tale which takes us
to the barren banks of the Spree.</p>

<p>Ever since the Thirty Years War, Germany had been the
battlefield of Europe. The ambitions of the Napoleon who
was four feet tall and smooth shaven and the prospective ambitions
of the Napoleon who was five feet tall and who waxed
his moustachios, had given and were actually giving that country
very little rest. The intelligentsia of the defunct Holy Roman
Empire saw but a single road which could lead to salvation.
The old German State must be re-established and the
kings of Prussia must become heirs to the traditions of Charlemagne.
To prove this point it was necessary that the obedient
subjects of half a hundred little potentates be filled with certain
definite historical notions about the glorious past of Heinrich
the Fat and Konrad the Lean. The patient historical
camels of the Teutonic universities were driven into the heart
of <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Historia Deserta</i> and brought back those stupendous bricks
of learning out of which the rulers of the land could build their
monuments to the glorious memory of the Ancestors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span></p>

<p>Whatever their faults and however misguided the ambition
of these faithful beasts of burden, they knew how to work.
The whole world looked on with admiration. Here, at last,
in this country of scientific precision, history had been elevated
to the rank of a “<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Wissenschaft</i>.” Carrying high their banners,
“For God, for Country, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">und wie es eigentlich dagewesen</i>,” all
good historians went upon a crusade to save the Holy Land of
the Past from the Ignorance of the Present.</p>

<p>That was in the blessed days when a first-class passage to
Hamburg and Bremen cost forty-six dollars and seventy-five
cents. Henry Adams and John Lothrop Motley were among
the first of the pilgrims. They drank a good deal of beer, listened
to many excellent concerts, and assisted, “privatissime
and gratis,” at the colloquia docta of many highly learned <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Geheimräte</i>,
and departed before they had suffered serious damage.
Others did not fare as well. Three—four—five years they
spent in the company of the Carolingians and the Hohenstaufens.
After they had soaked themselves sufficiently in Ploetz
and Bernheim to survive the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Examen Rigorosum</i> of the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Hochgelehrte
Facultät</i>, they returned to their native shore to spread
the gospel of true <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Wissenschaftlichkeit</i>.</p>

<p>There was nothing typically American in this. It happened
to the students of every country of the globe.</p>

<p>Of course, in making this point, we feel that we expose ourselves
to the accusation of a slight exaggeration. “How now,”
the industrious reader exclaims, “would you advocate a return
to the uncritical days of the Middle Ages?” To which we
answer, “By no means.” But history, like cooking or fiddling,
is primarily an art. It embellishes life. It broadens our tolerance.
It makes us patient of bores and fools. It is without
the slightest utilitarian value. A handbook of chemistry or
higher mathematics has a right to be dull. A history, never.
And the professional product of the Teutonic school resembled
those later-day divines who tried to console the dying by a
recital of the Hebrew verb <em>abhar</em>.</p>

<p>This system of preaching the gospel of the past filled the
pulpits but it emptied the pews. The congregation went elsewhere
for its historical enlightenment. Those who were seriously
interested turned to the works of a few laymen (hardware<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
manufacturers, diplomats, coal-dealers, engineers) who
devoted their leisure hours to the writing of history, or imported
the necessary intellectual pabulum from abroad. Others
took to the movies and since those temples of democratic delight
do not open before the hour of noon, they spent the early
morning perusing the endless volumes of reminiscences, memoirs,
intimate biographies, and recollections which flood the
land with the energy of an intellectual <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cloaca maxima</i>.</p>

<p>But all this, let us state it once more, did not matter very
much. When all is peace and happiness—when the hospitals
are empty of patients—when the weather is fine and people are
dying at the usual rate—it matters little whether the world at
large takes a deep interest in the work of the Board of Health.
The public knows that somewhere, somehow, someway, there
exists a Board of Health composed of highly trained medical
experts. They also appreciate from past experiences that these
watchful gentlemen “know their job” and that no ordinary
microbe can hope to move from Warsaw to Chicago without
prompt interference on the part of the delousing squad. But
when an epidemic threatens the safety of the community, then
the public hastens to the nearest telephone booth—calls up the
Health Commissioners and follows their instructions with implicit
faith. It demands that these public servants shall spend
the days of undisturbed health to prepare for the hour of sickness
when there is no time for meditation and experiment.</p>

<p>The public at large had a right to expect a similar service
from its historians. But unfortunately, when the crisis came,
the scientific historical machine collapsed completely.</p>

<p>In Germany, the home country of the system of <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">historische
Wissenschaftlichkeit</i>, the historian became the barker outside
the Hohenzollern main tent, shouting himself hoarse for the
benefit of half-hearted fellow citizens and hostile neutrals, extolling
the ancestral Teutonic virtues until the whole world
turned away in disgust. In France, they arrange those things
better. Even the most unhealthy mess of nationalistic scraps
can be turned into a palatable dish by a competent cook of
the Parisian school. In England, the historian turned propagandist,
and for three years, the surprised citizens of Copenhagen,
Bern, and Madrid found their mail boxes cluttered with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
mysterious bundles of state documents duly stamped, beautifully
illustrated, and presented (as the enclosed card showed)
with the compliments of Professor So-and-so of Such-and-such
College, Oxford, England. In Russia, a far-seeing government
had taken its measures many years before. Those historians
who had refused to be used as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cheval de bataille</i> for the glory
of the house of Romanoff, were either botanising along the
banks of the Lena or had long since found a refuge in the universities
of Sofia and Geneva. I do not know what happened
in Japan, but I have a suspicion that it was the same thing,
the entire world over.</p>

<p>The historian turned apologist. He was as useful as a doctor
who would show a partiality to the native streptococcus on
the grounds of loyalty to the land of his birth.</p>

<p>What happened on this side of the ocean after the first three
years of “peace without victory” had given place to “force
to the uttermost” is too well known to demand repetition.
Long before the first American destroyer reached Plymouth,
the staunch old vessel of history had been <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">spurlos versenkt</i> in
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mare clausum</i> of the Western hemisphere. Text-books were
recalled, rehashed, and revamped to suit the needs of the hour.
Long and most deservedly forgotten treatises were called back
to life and with the help of publishers’ blurbs and reviews by
members of the self-appointed guardians of national righteousness
they were sent forth to preach the gospel of domestic virtue.
Strange encyclopædias of current information were concocted
by volunteers from eager faculties. The public mind
was a blank. For a hundred years the little children had
learned to dislike history and grown-ups had revaluated this
indifference into actual hate. This situation had been created
to maintain on high the principles of scientific historical investigation.
Let popular interest perish as long as the Truth
stand firm. But in the hour of need, the guardians of the
Truth turned gendarmes, the doors of Clio’s temple were
closed, and the public was invited to watch the continuation of
the performance in the next moving-picture house. At Versailles
the curtain went down upon the ghastly performance.</p>

<p>After the first outbreak of applause the enthusiasm waned.
Who had been responsible for this terrible tragedy? The supposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
authors were branded as enemies of mankind. Nations
tottered and ancient Empires crumbled to dust and were hastily
carried to the nearest historical scrapheap. The ambitious
monarch, who for thirty years had masqueraded as a second
Charlemagne, made his exit amidst properties borrowed from
the late King Louis Philippe. The gay young leader of the
Death Head Hussars developed into the amateur bicycle-repairer
of the island of Wieringen. International reputations
retailed at a price which could only be expressed in Soviet
rubles and Polish marks and no takers. The saviour of the
world became the invalid of the White House. But not a
word was said about those inconspicuous authors of very conspicuous
historical works who had been the henchmen of the
<cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Oberste</cite> and <cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Unterste Kriegsherren</cite>. They went back to the
archives to prepare the necessary post-mortem statements.
These are now being published at a price which fortunately
keeps them well out of reach of the former soldiers.</p>

<p>In certain dramas and comedies of an older day it was customary
to interrupt the action while the Chorus of moralising
Villagers reviewed what had gone before and drew the necessary
conclusions. It is time for the “goat-singers” to make
their appearance.</p>

<p>“Are you, O Author,” so they speak, “quite fair when
you pronounce these bitter words? Are we not all human—too
human? Is it reasonable to demand of our historians that
they shall possess such qualities of detached judgment as have
not been seen on this earth since the last of the Mighty Gods
departed from High Olympus? Has a historian no heart? Do
you expect him to stand by and discuss the virtues of vague
political questions, when all the world is doing its bit—while
his children are risking their lives for the safety of the common
land?”</p>

<p>And when we are approached in this way, we find it difficult
to answer “no.” For we too are an animated compound of
prejudice and unreasonable preferences and even more unreasoning
dislikes, and we do not like to assume the rôle of
both judge and jury.</p>

<p>The evidence, however, gives us no chance to decide otherwise.
What was done in the heat of battle—what was done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
under the stress of great and sincere emotions—what was
written in the agony of a thousand fears—all that will be forgotten
within a few years. But enough will remain to convince
our grandchildren that the historian was among those most
guilty of creating that “state of mind” without which modern
warfare would be an impossibility.</p>

<p>Here the music of the flutes grows silent. The Chorus steps
back and the main action of our little play continues. The
time is “the present” and the problem is “the future.” The
children who are now in the second grade will be called upon
to bear the burden of a very long period of reconstruction.
America, their home, has been compared to an exceedingly
powerful and influential woman who is not very popular but
who must not be offended on account of her eminent social
position. The folk who live along our international Main
Street are not very well disposed towards a neighbour who holds
all the mortgages and lives in the only house that has managed
to survive the recent catastrophe. It will not be an easy thing
to maintain the peace in the neurasthenic community of the
great post-war period. It has been suggested that the Ten
Commandments, when rightly applied, may help us through
the coming difficulties. We beg to suggest that a thorough
knowledge of the past will prove to be quite as useful as the
Decalogue. We do not make this statement hastily. Furthermore,
we qualify it by the observation that both History and
the Decalogue will be only two of a great many other remedies
that will have to be applied if the world is to be set free
from its present nightmare of poison gas and high-velocity
shells. But we insist that History be included. And we do
so upon the statement of a learned and famous colleague who
passed through a most disastrous war and yet managed to keep
a cool head. We mean Thucydides. In his foreword to the
History of the Peloponnesian War he wrote: “The absence of
romance in my history will, I fear, detract somewhat from
its interest; but if it be judged by those inquirers who desire
an exact knowledge of the past as an aid to the interpretation
of the future, which in the course of human things, must resemble,
if it does not reflect it, I shall be content.”</p>

<p>When we measure out achievements in the light of this ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
Greek ideal, we have accomplished very little indeed. An
enormous amount of work has been done and much of it is
excellent. The great wilderness of the past has been explored
with diligent care and the material lies, carefully classified, in
those literary museums which we call libraries. But the public
refuses to go in. No one has ever been able to convince
the man in the street that time employed upon historical reading
is not merely time wasted. He carries with him certain
hazy notions about a few names, Cæsar and Joan of Arc (since
the war) and Magna Charta and George Washington and Abraham
Lincoln. He remembers that Paul Revere took a ride,
but whither and for what purpose he neither knows nor cares
to investigate. The historical tie which binds him to the past
and which alone can make him understand his own position in
relation to the future, is non-existent. Upon special occasions
the multitude is given the benefit of a grand historical pyrotechnic
display, paid for by the local Chamber of Commerce, and
a few disjointed facts flash by amidst the fine roar of rockets
and the blaring of a brass band. But this sort of historical
evangelising has as little value as the slapstick vespers which
delight the congregation of Billy Sunday’s circus tent.</p>

<p>We live in an age of patent medicines. The short-cut to
success is the modern <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pons asinorum</i> which leads to happiness.
And remedies which are “guaranteed to cure” are advertised
down the highways and byways of our economic and social
world. But no such cure exists for the sad neglect of an historical
background. History can never be detached from life. It
will continue to reflect the current tendencies of our modern
world until that happy day when we shall discontinue the
pursuit of a non-essential greatness and devote our energies
towards the acquisition of those qualities of the spirit without
which human existence (at its best) resembles the proverbial
dog-kennel.</p>

<p>For the coming of that day we must be as patient as Nature.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> one of the popular plays of last season, a melodrama
toned up with snatches of satire and farce, the wife was
portrayed as a beaten dog heeling her master after he has
crushed her down across the table the better to rowel off her
nose. Not until the would-be mutilator was finally disposed
of by an untrammelled Mexican did the woman feel free to go
to her lover, and even then she took little or no satisfaction in
the venture. As for the lover, he had to be robbed of his pistol
by the husband and shot at, and then—the husband out of the
way—threatened by the bandit with the loss of the woman, before
he felt free to take her. The two New Englanders were
made happy in spite of themselves—and in accordance with
the traditions or conventions of the audience.</p>

<p>To leave a husband for a lover is in theory un-American,
unless the husband gives a legal ground for divorce and the
divorce is secured. In several States cruelty is a legal ground,
and so the conjugal fidelity of the stage-heroine was perhaps
overdrawn. But the feeling that she was presumed to share
with the audience—that the initiative towards freedom in love
should not come from her—is a characteristic trait of American
morality. If your husband is unrestrainedly a brute or a
villain, you may leave him, in fact it behooves you to leave
him, but if he is merely a bore, or perhaps a man you like well
enough as a friend, but only as a friend, you must stay on
with him in an intimacy where boredom readily becomes aversion
and mere friendliness, disgust. The fact that you do not
love a person is no reason at all, in American opinion, for not
living as if you did.</p>

<p>This opinion or attitude is explicit in American divorce law.
In none of the States is divorce granted either by mutual consent
or at the desire, the overt desire, of either person. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
fact collusion, as mutual consent is called, is accounted a
reason against granting divorce, and desire for divorce on the
part of one remains ineffectual until the other has been forced
into entertaining it. He or she must be given due ground.
Disinclination to intimacy is not of itself due ground. You
must express disinclination in a way so disagreeable that he
or she will want to get rid of you. The law sets a premium
on being hateful, declares indeed that in this case it is an indispensable
condition to not being miserable.</p>

<p>The grotesqueness, from either a social or psychological
point of view, would be too obvious to emphasize, if the implications
of this attitude towards divorce were not so significant
of American attitudes at large towards sex—attitudes of repression
or deception. Of deception or camouflage towards
divorce there is one other conspicuous point I should like to
note. “Strictness of divorce” is commonly argued to be protection
of marriage for the sake of children, since brittle marriage
is destructive of the family life. It is safe to say that
from no contemporary discussion of divorce will this argument
be omitted; and it is equally safe to say that the rejoinder
that divorce laws should therefore discriminate between parents
and non-parents will, by the opponents of divorce, pass unheeded.
That this distinction should be so persistently ignored
is accountable only, it seems to me, on the ground of
emotional self-deception. What else but a covert emotional
attitude could make tenable the irrationality, and what else is
that attitude but that joy in mating is of negligible value,
that sex emotion, if not a necessary evil, is at any rate a
negligible good, deserving merely of what surplus of attention
may be available from the real business of life? Indifference
towards sex emotion is masked by concern for offspring.</p>

<p>In France, we may note, this confusion between parenthood
and mating does not exist. The parental relation in both law
and custom is highly regulated, much more regulated than
among English-speaking peoples, but it is unlikely that it would
be argued in France that mating and parenthood were inseparable
concepts. Unlikely, because the French attitude towards
sex differs so radically from the Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span></p>

<p>To the French, as to many of the Continental peoples of
Europe, sexual interest is normally to be kept stimulated,
neither covered over nor suppressed. And in this case stimulation
is seen to depend largely upon the factor of interrelation.
Sex-facts are to be related to other facts of life, not
rigidly or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i>, as in the American view that mating is inseparable
from parenthood, but fluently and realistically, as
life itself moves and finds expression. And sex-facts in European
opinion are to be interrelated in a philosophy of sex.
Failure to make these interrelations, together with the attitude
of suppression, seem to me to be the outstanding aspects of
the characteristically American attitude towards sex.</p>

<p>There is no need in this post-Freudian day of dwelling upon
the effects of suppression of sex instinct or impulse. Suppression
leads, we are told, either to sublimation, in which case it
is diversion, rather than suppression, or it leads to perversion
or disease. Unfortunately sex-pathology in the United States
has been given little or no study, statistically. We have no
statistical data of health or disease in relation to the expression
or suppression of sex instinct, and no data on the extent or
the effects of homosexuality or of the direction of the sex impulses
towards self. Opinion therefore becomes merely a matter
of personal observation and conclusion, observation of individuals
or small groups. My own conclusion or guess in regard
to perversion in this country is that part of the commonly
observed spirit of isolation or antagonism between the sexes,
and part of the spirit of competition between individuals, are
associated with homosexual or masturbatory tendencies which
get expressed in varying degrees according to varying circumstances.
More particularly the lack of warmth in personal
intercourse which makes alike for American bad manners and,
in the more intellectual circles, for cheerlessness and aridity is
due, I think, to failure of one kind or another in sex relations.
I mean cultural failure, not merely individual failure.</p>

<p>May not some such theory of sex failure account also for
that herd sense which is so familiar a part of Americanism,
and which is not incompatible with the type of self-seeking
or pseudo-individualism of which American individualism appears
to be an expression? It is a tenable hypothesis that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
sexually isolated individuals become dependent upon the group
for stimulus, whether of emotion or will, whereas persons in
normal sex relations, although they may contribute to the group
or co-operate with it, remain comparatively independent of it,
finding stimulus in sex and its sublimations.</p>

<p>If this theory is valid, we may expect to find a comparatively
large number of sex failures in those circles which are
characterized by what Everett Dean Martin has recently
called crowd behaviour, reform circles intolerant of other
mindedness and obsessed by belief in the paramountcy of their
own dogma.</p>

<p class="in0">Were a set of tests for sex failure or sex fulfilment applied to
the more outstanding propagandists of this country, likewise,
of course, for comparative purposes, to an adequate number
of non-propagandists, the results might be of considerable
significance. I recommend the undertaking to the National
Research Council in co-operation with some organization for
social hygiene.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in what measure propagandism of various sorts
may be a perversion of sex or a sublimation remains speculative;
and in applying theory one should be thoroughly aware
that from the day of Sappho and before to the day of Elizabeth
Blackwell and after, even to the Russian Revolution, sex
failure of one kind or another, the kind considered at the time
most despicable, has commonly been imputed to persons or
groups disapproved of on other grounds or reprobated. Some
sublimation of sex in the United States there must be, of course,
not only, in propaganda movements, but in other expressions
of American culture, in American art and letters and science,
in philanthropy, in politics, finance, and business. By and
large, however, in all these cultural expressions does one see
any conspicuous measure of sex sublimation? Is not the concern
practical rather than devotional, a matter of getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
rather than giving, of self-advancement or family support
rather than of interest in ideas and their forms or in the values
of taste or of faith?</p>

<p>Interest in impersonal subjects in general is not an American
trait. Personal concrete terms are the terms commonly
used. Americans, as we say, are not given to abstract thought
or philosophy. They are interested in facts as facts, not as
related to other facts. How expect of Americans, therefore,
that kind of curiosity about sex which leads to a philosophy of
sex? Sex curiosity in American life does not lead past curiosity
about isolated facts, and that means that it leads not to philosophy
but to gossip and pruriency. Not long ago I was talking
with a woman about a common acquaintance to whom I referred
as singularly free through sophistication and circumstance
to please any man she liked. “What do you mean?
Have you heard any scandal about her?” snapped out my
companion, not at all interested in the general reflection, but
avid of information about illicit affairs.</p>

<p>Facts which are not held together through theory call for
labels. People who do not think in terms of relations are
likely to be insistent upon names. Labels or names for sex
disposition or acts are, as a matter of fact, very definite in the
American vernacular. “Engaged,” “attentive,” “devoted,”
“a married man,” “a man of family,” “a grass widow,” “a
<em>good</em> woman,” “a <em>bad</em> woman”—there is no end to such tags.
Again, intimacy between a man and a woman is referred definitely
to the act of consummation, a sex relation is strictly
classified according to whether or not it is physically consummated.
In this attitude towards sex boundaries or captions
may lie the explanation, incidentally, of what is a constant
puzzle to the European visitor—the freedom of social intercourse
allowed to the youth of opposite sexes. Since consummation
only constitutes sexual intimacy in American opinion,
and since consummation, it is assumed, is utterly out of the
question, why raise barriers between boys and girls? The
assumption that consummation is out of the question is, by and
large, correct, which is still another puzzle. To this some clue
may be found, I think, in our concluding discussion.</p>

<p>Fondness for captions and for the sort of classification that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
is so likely to paralyze perception of the finer distinctions
and to arrest thought, are natural enough in a child, learning
language and so pressed upon by the multiplicity of phenomena
that in self-protection he must make rough classifications
and remain unaware of much. The old who are dying to life
are also exclusive, and they, too, cling to formulas. Is American
culture in the matter of sex childish and immature, as
Americans imply when they refer to their “young country,” or
is the culture representative of the aged; are Americans born
old, as now and again a European critic asserts?</p>

<p>Such terms of age are figurative, of course, unless we take
them in a historical sense, meaning either that a new culture
was developed in this country—or rather that there were fresh
developments of an old culture—or that an old culture was
introduced and maintained without significant change. This
is not the place to discuss the cultural aspects of Colonial
America, but it is important to bear in mind in any discussion
of merely contemporaneous sex attitudes in this country the
contributions of European, and more particularly, English
morality. Without recalling the traditions of early Christianity
or of English Puritanism, those attitudes of ignoring or
suppressing the satisfactions of the impulses of sex to which we
have referred were indeed incomprehensible and bewildering—mere
psychological interpretation seems inadequate. But
viewed as consequences of the sense of sin in connection with
sex, which was a legacy from Paul and his successors in English
Puritanism, interpretation is less difficult, and the American attitude
toward sex becomes comparatively intelligible—the attitude
seen in divorce and in the melodramas, and in the standardizing
of sex relations, in accordance with that most significant
of Pauline dogmas that marriage is the lesser of two evils,
that it is better to marry than to burn. Without the key of
Paul and of the obscenities of the early Christian Fathers how
explain the recent legislation in Virginia making it a crime
to pay attention to a married man or woman, or such a sermon
as was recently preached somewhere in the Middle West
urging a crusade against the practice of taking another man’s
wife in to dinner or dancing round dances? “At a dinner of
friends let every man take his own wife on his arm and walk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
in to their seats side by side at the dinner table to the inspiring
music of ‘Onward Christian Soldiers,’” urged the minister.
As to dancing, whenever a man is seen to put his arm around
a woman who is not his wife, the band should cease playing.
I do not quote the words of the latter injunction, as they are
rather too indecent.</p>

<p>Turning from the historical back to the psychological point
of view—in one of those circles of cause and effect that are
composed now of cultural inheritance or tradition, now of psychological
trend or disposition—the American case of sex,
whether a case of adolescence or of senescence, may be said to
present symptoms of arrested development. Together with
the non-realism of childish or senile formula, there is here the
kind of emotionalism which checks emotional vitality and
which is fed upon the sense of crisis; we may call it crisis-emotion.
Life at large, the sex life in particular, is presented
as a series of crises preceded and followed by a static condition,
and in these conventional times of crisis only, the times
when the labels are being attached, are the emotions aroused.
In the intervals, in the stretches between betrothal, marriage,
birth, christening, or divorce, there is little or no sense of
change—none of the emotions that correspond to changing relations
and are expressions of personal adjustment. The emotions
of crisis are statutory, pre-determined, conventionalized;
neither for oneself nor for others do they make any demands
upon imagination, or insight, or spiritual concern.</p>

<p>Here in this psychology of crisis is the clue—before mentioned—to
an understanding of the freedom allowed our youth,
of “bundling,” as the Colonials termed it, or, in current phrase,
“petting.” In general, “keeping company” is accounted
one kind of a relationship, marriage, another—one characterized
by courtship without consummation, the other by consummation
without courtship. Between the two kinds of relationship
there is no transition, it is assumed, except by convention
or ritual. So inrooted is this social attitude that the
young cannot escape adopting it, at least the very young to
whom, at any rate, uncritical conservatism seems to be natural.
Indeed the taboo on unritualized consummation partakes
enough of the absolutism of the taboo, shall we say, on incest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
to preclude any risk of individual youthful experimentation
or venture across the boundary lines set by the Elders.</p>

<p>Given these boundary lines, given a psychology of crisis, all
too readily the sex relations, in marriage or out, become stale,
flat, colourless, or of the nature of debauch, which is only another
aspect of crisis-psychology. Sex relations perforce become
limited to two conventions, marriage and prostitution.
Prostitute or wife, the conjugal or the disorderly house, these
are the alternatives. In formulaic crisis-psychology there may
be no other station of emotional experiment or range of emotional
expression.</p>

<p>That a man should “sow his wild oats” before marriage,
and after marriage “settle down,” is becoming throughout the
country a somewhat archaic formula, at least in so far as wild
oats means exposure to venereal disease; but there has been
no change, so far as I am aware, in the attitude towards the
second part of the formula on settling down—in conjugal segregation.
The married are as obtrusively married as ever, and
their attitude towards persons of the opposite sex as dull and
forbidding. Few “happily married” women but refer incessantly
in their conversation to their husband’s opinion or stand;
and what devoted husband will fail to mention his wife in one
way or another as a notice of his immunity against the appeal
of sex in any degree by any other woman? Shortly after the
war, a certain American woman of my acquaintance who was
travelling in France found herself without money and in danger
of being put off her train before reaching Paris and her
banker’s. She found a fellow-countryman and told him her
predicament. He was quite willing to pay her fare; she was
an American and a woman, but she was informed firmly and
repeatedly that her knight was a married man, and besides, he
was travelling with his business partner. Soon after I heard
this anecdote I happened to repeat it to a Chicago lawyer who
promptly joined in the laugh over the American man’s timidity.
“Still, a married man travelling can’t be too prudent,” he finished
off.</p>

<p>Circumspection towards women, in travel or elsewhere, or,
better still, indifference towards women, is the standardized
attitude of American husbands. In marriage, too, a relationship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
of status rather than of attention to the fluctuations of
personality, indifference to psychical experience, is a not uncommon
marital trait. American men in general, as Europeans
have noted, are peculiarly indifferent to the psychology of
women. They are also peculiarly sentimental about women,
a trait quite consistent with indifference or ignorance, but one
which, in view of American prostitution and the persistent
exclusion of many women from equal opportunities for education
and for life, gives an ugly look of hypocrisy to the trumpeters
of American chivalry.</p>

<p>And yet subject the American concept of chivalry to a little
scrutiny and the taunt, at least of hypocrisy, will miss the mark.
For the concept is, both actually and historically, a part of the
already noted classification of women as more or less sequestered,
on the one hand, and unsequestered or loose on the other,
as inexperienced and over-experienced or, more accurately, partially
over-experienced. In this classification the claims of
both classes of women are settled by men on an economic basis,
with a few sentimentalities about womanhood, pure or impure,
thrown in for good measure. The personality of the woman
a man feels that he is supporting, whether as wife or prostitute,
may, theoretically, be disregarded and, along with her personality,
her capacity for sexual response. Whether as a creature
of sin or as an object of chivalry, a woman becomes a depersonalized,
and, sexually, an unresponsive being.</p>

<p>People sometimes forget this when they discuss the relations
between men and women in this country, and especially the
sexlessness or coldness of American women. They forget it in
arguing against the feminizing of education, the theatre, literature,
etc., meaning, not that women run the schools or are
market for the arts, but that immature, sexless women are in
these ways too much to the fore. In part at least it is thanks
to chivalry or to her “good and considerate husband” that
the American woman, the non-wage earner at least, does not
grow up, and that it is possible for so many women to marry
without having any but the social consequences of marriage in
mind. One surmises that there are numbers, very large numbers,
of American women, married as well as unmarried, who
have felt either no stirring of sex at all or at most only the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
generalized sex stir of pre-adolescence. What proportion of
women marry “for a home” or to escape from a home, or a
job, and what proportion marry for love? After marriage,
with the advent of children, what of these proportions?</p>

<p>Marriage for a home or for the sake of children, chivalry,
“consideration” for the wife, all these attitudes are matters
of status, not of personality, and to personality, not to status,
love must look, since love is an art, not a formula. It often
seems that in American culture, whether in marriage or out,
little or no place is open to this patient, ardent, and discerning
art, and that lovers are invariably put to flight. Even if they
make good their escape, their adventure is without social significance,
since it is perforce surreptitious. Only when adventurers
and artists in love are tolerated enough to be able to come
out from under cover, and to be at least allowed to live, if only
as variants from the commonplace, may they contribute of their
spirit or art to the general culture.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_FAMILY">THE FAMILY</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> American family is the scapegoat of the nations.
Foreign critics visit us and report that children are forward
and incorrigible, that wives are pampered and extravagant,
and that husbands are henpecked and cultureless. Nor
is this the worst. It only skims the surface by comparison
with the strictures of home-grown criticism. Our domestic
arbiters of every school have a deeper fault to find: they see
the family as a crumbling institution, a swiftly falling bulwark.
Catholic pulpits call upon St. Joseph to save the ruins and
Puritan moralists invoke Will Carlton, believing in common
with most of our public guardians that only saints and sentimentalism
can help in such a crisis. Meanwhile the American
family shows the usual tenacity of form, beneath much superficial
change, uniting in various disguises the most ancient and
the newest modes of living. In American family life, if anywhere,
the Neolithic meets the modern and one needs to be
very rash or very wise to undertake the nice job of finding
out which is which. But one at least refuses to defeat one’s
normal curiosity by joining in the game of blind-man’s buff,
by means of which public opinion about the family secures a
maximum of activity along with a minimum of knowledge.</p>

<p>A little science would be of great help. But popular opinion
does not encourage scientific probing of the family. In this
field, not honesty but evasion is held to be the best policy.
Rather than venture where taboo is so rife and the material so
sensitive, American science would much rather promote domestic
dyes and seedless oranges. It is true that we have the Federal
Census with its valuable though restrained statistics. But
even the census has always taken less interest in family status
and family composition, within the population, than in the
classification of property and occupation and the fascinating
game of “watching Tulsa grow.” In no country is the collection
of vital statistics so neglected and sporadic and the total<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
yield of grab-bag facts so unamenable to correlation. Through
the persistent effort of the Children’s Bureau, this situation
has been considerably improved during the past ten years; so
that now there exist the so-called “registration areas” where
births, marriages, and deaths are actually recorded. For the
country as a whole, these vital facts still go unregistered. The
prevailing sketchiness in the matter of vital statistics is in distinct
contrast to the energy and thoroughness with which
American political machinery manages to keep track of the
individual who has passed the age of twenty-one.</p>

<p>One of the tendencies, statistically verified, of the native
family is its reduction in size. In the first place the circumference
of the family circle has grown definitely smaller
through the loss of those adventitious members, the maiden
aunt and the faithful servant. The average number of adult
females in the typical household is nowadays just one. The
odd women are out in the world on their own; they no longer
live “under the roofs” of their brothers-in-law. Miss Lulu
Bett is almost an anachronism in 1920. The faithful servant
has been replaced by the faithless one, who never by any
chance remains long enough to become a familial appendage,
or else she has not been replaced at all. Even “Grandma”
has begun to manifest symptoms of preferring to be on her
own. Thus the glory of the patriarchal household has visibly
departed, leaving only the biological minimum in its stead.</p>

<p>In the dwindling of this ultimate group lies the crux of the
matter. The American grows less and less prolific, and panicky
theorists can already foresee a possible day when the last 100
per cent. American Adam and the last 100 per cent. American
Eve will take their departure from our immigrationized stage.
It is providentially arranged—the maxim tells us—that the
trees shall not grow and grow until they pierce the heavens;
but is there any power on the job of preventing the progressive
decline of the original Anglo-Saxon stock even to the point of
final extinction? This is a poignant doubt in a country where
the Anglo-Saxon strain enjoys a prestige out of all proportion
to its population quota. The strain may derive what comfort
it can from the reflection that the exit of the Indian was probably
not due to birth control.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span></p>

<p>Still, birth control is not new. If it did not originate with
the Indians, it did at least with the Puritans. As the census
books and genealogy books show, every succeeding American
generation has manifested a tendency to reduce the birth-rate.
The new aspects of the situation are the acceleration of the
tendency and the propaganda for family limitation by artificial
methods. In the birth registration area, which includes twenty-three
States, the number of births for the year 1919 compared
with those for 1918 showed a slump of seven per cent. Also
the current assumption that children are more numerous on
farms, where they are an economic asset, than they are in
cities, where they became an economic handicap, has recently
received a startling correction through a survey made by the
Department of Agriculture. Among the surprises of the study,
says the report, was the small number of children in farm
homes:—“Child life is at a premium in rural districts.” The
farm is not the national child reserve it has been supposed to
be. As far as the salaried class is concerned, it has stood
out as the national pace-setter in family limitation. The editorial
writer of the New York <cite>Times</cite>, who may be trusted for
a fairly accurate statement of the standards of this group,
justifies its conduct thus: “Unless the brain-worker is willing
to disclass his children, to subject them to humiliation, he
must be willing to feed, clothe, and educate them during many
years. In such circumstances, to refuse parenthood is only
human.” It therefore remains for the manual worker, who
cannot obtain from his Church the same absolution that the
suburban resident can obtain from his <cite>Times</cite>, to produce the
bulk of the population. This, as a whole, is not yet stationary;
the recent census estimates an annual excess of births over
deaths throughout the United States amounting to about one
per cent. What will the next decade do with it?</p>

<p>A peculiar feature of the American propaganda for birth
control is its specific advocacy of artificial methods. The defenders
of this cause have been compelled, it appears, to define
a position which would be self-evident in any society not
incorrigibly Puritan. People who regard celibacy as a state
of grace and celibacy within marriage as a supreme moral victory
are still growing, it would seem, on every bush. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
unwholesome belief must have its effect upon the birth control
methods of the married population. It is a matter of speculation
how many marriages succumb to its influence, especially
after the birth of a second or third child; but there is reason
to believe that the ascetic method is by no means uncommon.
You cannot hold up an ideal before people steadily for forty
years without expecting some of them to try to follow it. This
kind of rigorous negativism passes for morality in America and
finds its strongest devotees among the middle-aged and the
heads of families. Such people are greatly shocked at the wild
conduct of the young who are certainly out of bounds since the
war; but the most striking feature of the current wave of so-called
immorality is the exposure of the bankruptcy of ideals
among the older generation. There are thirty million families
in the United States; presumably there are at least sixty million
adults who have experimented with the sexual relationship
with the sanction of society. But experience has taught them
nothing if one may judge by the patented and soulless concepts
which still pass for sexual morality among people who are
surely old enough to have learned about life from living it.</p>

<p>The population policies of the government are confined to
the supply through immigration. A few years ago, an American
president enunciated population policies of his own and
conducted an energetic though solitary campaign against “race
suicide.” But no faction rallied to his standard, no organization
rose up to speed his message. His bugle-call was politely
disregarded as the personal idiosyncrasy of a popular president
who happened to be the proud father of six children.
Mr. Roosevelt was evidently out of tune with his own generation,
as, no doubt, Mr. Washington was with his, for exactly
the opposite reason. But the more retiring nature of our first
president saved him from the egoistic error of regarding his
own familial situation as the only proper and desirable example.
The complete failure of Mr. Roosevelt’s crusade is significant.
There are clerical influences in America which actively fight
race suicide, but with these obscurantist allies the doughty
son of a Dutch Reform family had too little else in common.
Among the men of his own class he stirred not an echo. Is it
because the American husband is too uxorious or too indifferent?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
I have heard a married man say, “It is too much to
expert of any woman;” and still another one explain, “The
Missis said it was my turn next and so we stopped with one.”
Or is there any explanation in the fact that the American
father tends more and more to spend his life in a salaried job
and has little land or business to bequeath? Whatever the
reason, the Business Man is in accord with the Club Woman
on the subject of birth control, in practice if not in theory.</p>

<p>So far as relative distribution of income is concerned, the
families of the United States fare much as those in the industrial
countries of Europe. In 1910, the same relative inequality
of wealth and income existed in feudal Prussia and democratic
America. The richest fifth of the families in each
country claimed about half the income while the poorest two-thirds
of the families were thankful for about one-third. The
same law of economic relativity falls alike on the just American
and the unjust Prussian. But the American family, it
appears, is in every case two or three times better off than the
corresponding family in Prussia. You must multiply Herr
Stinnes by two to get a Judge Gary and the wealth of a Silesian
child labourer is only half that of a Georgia mill-child. This
economic advantage of our American rich and poor alike is
measured chiefly in dollars and marks and not in actual standards
of living. It is apparently difficult to get real standards
of living out into the open; otherwise the superior fortune of
American families of every estate might be less evident. Some
of us who may have visited middle-class Prussian people only
half as well off as ourselves probably did not commiserate the
poor things as they deserved. My hostess, I recall, had eight
hundred dollars a year on which she maintained an apartment
of two rooms, bath, and kitchen; kept a part-time maid;
bought two new suits’ a year; drove out in a hired carriage on
Sunday; and contributed generously to a society which stirred
up women to call themselves Frau instead of Fräulein. Any
“single woman” in an American city of equal size who could
have managed as much in those days on fifteen hundred a year
would certainly have deserved a thumping thrift-prize....
And then there were all those poor little children in a Black
Forest village, who had to put up with rye bread six days in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
the week and white bread only on Sundays. Transported to
America, they might have had package crackers every day and
ice-cream sandwiches on Sunday. One wonders whether the
larger income of the American family is not largely spent on
things of doubtful value and pinchbeck quality.</p>

<p>According to theory, the income of the family normally belongs
to the man of the house. According to theory, he has
earned it or derived it from some lawful business enterprise.
“The head of the family ordinarily divides income between
himself and his various dependents in the proportion that he
deems best,” says Mr. Willford King. The American husband
has a peculiarly unblemished reputation as a provider—and
probably deserves it. Certainly few husbands in the world
are so thoughtful of their widows; they invest extensively in
life insurance but rarely in annuities against a period of retirement.
Trust Companies remind them through advertisements
every day to make their wills, and cemetery corporations nag
them incessantly to buy their graves. “Statistics show that
women outlive men!” says the promoter of America’s Burial
Park. “They show that the man who puts off the selection of
a burial place leaves the task to the widow in her grief. For
the man it is easy now—for the woman an ordeal then.” The
chivalry of the business man leads him to contrive all sorts
of financial mechanisms for his widow’s convenience and protection.
His will, like his insurance policy, is in her favour.
Unlike the European husband, he hates to leave the man’s
world of business and to spend his declining years in the society
of his wife. After he is dead, she is welcome to his all,
but so long as he lives he keeps business between them.</p>

<p>Though in life and death a generous provider, he is not a
systematic one. Financial arrangements between husband
and wife are extremely casual. As the dowry hardly exists,
so a regular cash allowance is very rare. He loves to hold the
purse-strings and let her run the bills. This tendency is known
in the outside business world, and the American wife, therefore,
enjoys a command of credit which would amaze any
solvent foreign housekeeper. She has accounts on every hand.
She orders food by telephone or through the grocer’s boy
and “charges it.” The department store expects her to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
a charge account, and gives her better service if she does. For
instance, the self-supporting woman who is, for obvious reasons,
more inclined to pay as she goes, finds herself discriminated
against in the matter of returning or exchanging goods. In
numerous ways, the charge account has the inside track. This
would not seem strange if credit were limited to the richest
fraction. But that is not the case; almost every housewife in
the country has credit, from the Newport ladies to the miners’
wives who “trade at the company store.” The only difference
is that, in the case of these two extremes—Newport and the
company store—longer credit than ususal seems to be the rule.
In the meantime, the preaching of thrift to the American
housewife goes on incessantly by apostles from a business
world which is largely organized on the assumption that she
does not possess it and which would be highly disconcerted if
she actually developed it. American business loves the housewife
for the same reason that it loves China—that is, for her
economic backwardness.</p>

<p>The record of the American husband as a provider is not
uniform for all classes. In Congress it is now and then asserted
with appropriate oratory that there are no classes in
America. This is more or less true from the point of view of
a Cabin Creek vote-getter, who lives in a factitious political
world, where economic realities fail to penetrate; to him
middle-class and working-class are much the same since they
have equal rights not to “scratch the ticket.” But the economist
finds it convenient, as has been said, to classify the totality
of American families in definite income-groups corresponding
to the Prussian classes. As one descends the income scale
one finds that the American husband no longer fulfils his
reputation for being sole provider for his family. According
to Edgar Sydenstricker, “less than half of the wage-earners’
families in the United States, whose heads are at work, have
been found to be supported by the earnings of the husband or
father.” The earnings of the mother and the children are a
necessary supplement to bring the family income up to the
subsistence level. Half the workingmen, who have dutifully
“founded” families, cannot support them. According to the
latest figures published, it costs $2,334 a year to keep a family<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
of five in New York. Have the young Lochinvars of the tenements
never heard of those appalling figures? Very likely they
have a premonition, if not an actual picture of the digits. In
any case they have their mothers to warn them. “Henry’s
brought it on himself,” said the janitress. “He had a right
not to get married. He had his mother to take care of him.”
If he had only chosen bachelorhood, he might have lived at
home in comfort and peace on his twenty-five a week. But
having chosen, or been chosen by, Mrs. Henry instead, it is
now up to the latter to go out office-cleaning or operating,
which she very extensively does. It is estimated that since
the war fully one-third of all American women in industry are
married.</p>

<p>Going back up the scale to the middle-class wife, we find
new influences at work upon her situation. Custom has relaxed
its condemnation of the economically independent wife,
and perhaps it is just as well that it has done so. For this is
the class which has suffered the greatest comparative loss of
fortune, during the last fifteen years. “If all estimates cited
are correct,” writes Mr. Willford King, “it indicates that, since
1896, there has occurred a marked concentration of income in
the hands of the very rich; that the poor have relatively lost
but little; but that the middle class has been the principal sufferer.”
It is, then, through the sacrifices of our middle-class
families that our very richest families have been able to improve
their standard of living. The poor, of course, have had
no margin on which to practise such benevolence, but the generous
middle-class has given till it hurts. The deficit had to
be relieved, the only possible way being through the economic
utilization of the women. At first daughters became self-supporting,
while wives still tarried in the odour of domestic sanctity;
then wives came to be sporadically self-supporting. The
war, like peace still bearing hardest on the middle-class, enhanced
all this. Nine months after the armistice, fifty per
cent. more women were employed in industry than there were
in the year before the war.</p>

<p>In America, we have no surplus women. The countries of
western Europe are each encumbered with a million or two,
and their existence is regarded as the source of acute social<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
problems. What shall be done with them is a matter of earnest
consideration and anxious statecraft. America has been spared
all this. She has also no surplus men—or none that anybody
has ever heard of. It is true that the population in 1910 consisted
of ninety-one millions, of whom forty-seven millions
were men and forty-four were women. There were three million
more men than women, but for some reason they were
not surplus or “odd” men and they have never been a “problem.”
The population figures for 1920,—one hundred and
five millions,—have not yet been divided by sexes, but the
chances are that there is still a man for every woman in the
country, and two men apiece for a great number of them.
However, no one seems to fear polyandry for America as
polygamy is now feared in Europe.</p>

<p>The situation is exceptional in New England where the typical
European condition is duplicated. Beyond the Berkshire
Hills, all the surplus women of America are concentrated. In
the United States as a whole there are a hundred and five men
for each one hundred women, but in New England the balance
shifts suddenly to the other side. Within the present century,
a gradual increase has taken place in the masculine contingent
owing to immigration. But the chances of marriage have not
correspondingly improved, for matches are rarely made between
New England spinsters and Armenian weavers or Neapolitan
bootblacks.</p>

<p>In America only the very rich and the very poor marry
early. Factory girls and heiresses are, as a rule, the youngest
brides. It is generally assumed that twenty-four for women
and twenty-nine for men are the usual ages for marriage the
country over. Custom varies enormously, of course, in so
polyglot a population. Now and then an Italian daughter acquires
a husband before the compulsory education law is
through with her. In such cases, however, there is apparently
a gentleman’s agreement between the truant officer and the
lady’s husband which solves the dilemma. At the opposite extreme
from these little working-class Juliets are the mature
brides of Boston. As the result of a survey covering the last
ten years, the registrar of marriage licenses discovered that
the women married between twenty-seven and thirty-three and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
the men between thirty and forty. Boston’s average marriage
age for both sexes is over thirty. This does not represent an
inordinate advance upon the practice of the primitive Bostonians.
According to certain American genealogists, the
Puritans of the 17th century were in no great haste to wed—the
average age of the bride being twenty-one and of the
bridegroom twenty-five. The marriage age in the oldest American
city has moved up about ten years in a couple of centuries.
The change is usually ascribed to increasing economic
obstacles, and nobody questions its desirability. Provided that
celibacy is all that it seems to be, the public stands ready to
admire every further postponement of the marriage age as
evidence of an ever-growing self-control and the triumphant
march of civilization.</p>

<p>In the majority of marriages, the American wife outlives
her husband. This is partly because he is several years older
than she and partly because she tends to be longer-lived than
he. Americans of the second and third generation are characterized
by great longevity,—the American woman of American
descent being the longest-lived human being on earth.
Consequently the survivors of marriage are more likely to be
widows than widowers. In the census of 1910, there were
about two million and a half widows of forty-five or over as
compared with about one million widowers of corresponding
age. Nor do they sit by the fire and knit as once upon a
time; they too must “hustle.” Among the working women
of the country are a million and a quarter who are more than
forty-five and who are probably to a very large extent—though
the census provides no data on the subject—economically
independent widows. As was said before, “Grandma”
too is on her own nowadays.</p>

<p>The widow enjoys great honour in American public life, although
it usually turns out to be rather a spurious and
sentimental homage. Political orators easily grow tearful
over her misfortunes. For generations after the Civil War,
the Republican Party throve on a pension-system which gathered
in the youngest widow of the oldest veteran, and Tammany
has always understood how to profit from its ostentatious
alms-giving to widows and orphans. From my earliest childhood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
I can recollect how the town-beautifiers, who wanted to
take down the crazy board fences, were utterly routed by the
aldermen who said the widow’s cow must range and people
must therefore keep up their fences. Similarly, the Southern
States have never been able to put through adequate child
labour laws because the widow’s child had to be allowed to
earn in order to support his mother. All this sentimentalism
proved to be in time an excellent springboard for a genuine
economic reform—the widow’s pension systems of the several
states which would be more accurately described as children’s
pensions. The legislatures were in no position to resist an appeal
on behalf of the poor widow and so nicely narcotized were
they by their traditional tender-heartedness that they failed
to perceive the socialistic basis of this new kind of widow’s
pensions. Consequently America has achieved the curious
honour of leading in a socialistic innovation which European
States are now only just beginning to copy. Maternity insurance,
on the other hand, has made no headway in America
although adopted years and even decades ago in European
countries. With us the obstacle seems to be prudishness
rather than capitalism—it makes a legislator blush to hear
childbirth spoken of in public while it only makes him cry to
hear of widowhood.</p>

<p>One aspect of widowhood is seldom touched upon and that
is its prevention. Aged widows, on the whole, in spite of their
soap-boxing and their wage-earning, are a very lonely race.
Why must they bring it on themselves by marrying men whose
expectation of life is so much less than theirs? And yet so
anxious are the marrying people to observe this conventional
disparity of age, that if the bride happens to be but by three
months the senior of the bridegroom, they conceal it henceforth
as a sort of family disgrace. Even if this convention
should prove to be immutable, is there nothing to be done
about the lesser longevity of the American male? There is a
life extension institute with an ex-president at the head but, as
far as I am aware, it has never enlisted the support of the
millions reported by the census as widows, who surely, if anybody,
should realize the importance of such a movement. It is
commonly assumed that the earlier demise of husbands is due<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
to the hazardous life they lead in business and in industry; but
domestic life is not without its hazards, and child-bearing is
an especially dangerous trade in the United States, which has
the highest maternal death-rate of seventeen civilized countries.
If American husbands were less philosophical about
the hardships of child-bed—the judgment of Eve and all that
sort of thing—and American wives were less philosophical
about burying their husbands—the Lord hath given and the
Lord hath taken away and so on—it might result in greater
health and happiness for all concerned.</p>

<p>But the main trouble with American marriage, as all the
world knows, is that divorce so often separates the twain before
death has any chance to discriminate between them. The
growing prevalence of divorce is statistically set forth in a
series of census investigations. In 1890, there was one divorce
to every sixteen marriages; in 1900, there was one to
every twelve marriages; and in 1916, there was one to every
nine marriages. The number of marriages in proportion to
the population has also increased during the same period,
though not at a rate equal to that of divorce. But divorce,
being so much younger than marriage, has had more room to
grow from its first humble scared beginnings of fifty years ago.
Queen Victoria’s frown had a very discouraging effect on divorce
in America; and Mrs. Humphry Ward, studying the
question among us in the early 20th century, lent her personal
influence towards the arrest of the American evil. We also
have raised up on this side of the water our own apostles against
divorce, among whom Mr. Horace Greeley perhaps occupies
the first and most distinguished place. But in spite of all
heroic crusades, divorce has continued to grow. One even suspects
that the marked increase in the marriage rate is partly—perhaps
largely—due to the remarriage of the divorced. At
any rate, they constitute new and eligible material for marriage
which formerly was lacking.</p>

<p>The true cause of the increase of divorce in America is not
easy to come by. Commissions and investigations have worried
the question to no profitable end, and have triumphantly
come out by the same door by which they went in. That seems
to be the test of a successful divorce inquiry; and no wonder,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
for the real quest means a conflict with hypocrisy and prejudice,
fear and taboo, which only the intrepid spirit of a John
Milton or a Susan B. Anthony is able to sustain. The people
who want divorces and who can pay for them seem to be able
to get them nowadays, and since it is the truth only that suffers
the situation has grown more tolerable.</p>

<p>In the meantime, there are popular impressions and assumptions
which do not tally with the known facts. It is assumed
that divorce is frequent in America because it is easy, and
that the logical way to reduce it would be to make it difficult.
Certain States of the West have lenient divorce laws but other
States have stringent laws, while South Carolina abolished divorce
entirely in 1878. On the whole, our laws are not so
lenient as those of Scandinavia, whose divorce rate is still far
behind that of the United States. Neither is divorce cheap in
America; it is enormously expensive. Therefore for the poor
it is practically inaccessible. The Domestic Relations Courts do
not grant divorce and the Legal Aid Societies will not touch it.
The wage-earning class, like the inhabitants of South Carolina,
just have to learn to get along without it. Then there is another
belief, hardly justified by the facts, that most divorced
wives get alimony. Among all the divorces granted in 1916,
alimony was not even asked for by 73 per cent. of the wives
and it was received altogether by less than 20 per cent. of them.
The statistics do not tell us whether the actual recipients of
alimony were the mothers of young children or whether they
were able-bodied ladies without offspring. The average American
divorce court could not be trusted to see any difference
between them.</p>

<p>The war has naturally multiplied the actions for divorce in
every country. It was not for nothing that the British government
called the stipends paid to soldiers’ wives “separation
allowances.” The war-time conditions had a tendency to
unmake marriages as well as to make them. The momentary
spread of divorce has revived again the idea of a uniform divorce
law embodied in an amendment to the Federal Constitution.
As no reasonable law can possibly be hoped for, the
present state of confusion is infinitely to be preferred as affording
at least some choice of resources to the individual who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
is seeking relief. If there were any tendency to take divorce
cases out of the hands of the lawyers, as has been done with
industrial accidents, and to put it into domestic relations courts
where it belongs; if there were the least possibility of curbing
the vested interest of the newspapers in divorce news; if there
were any dawning appreciation of the absurdity of penalizing
as connivance the most unanswerable reason for divorce, that
is, mutual consent; if there were any likelihood that the lying
and spying upon which divorce action must usually depend for
its success would be viewed as the grossest immorality in the
whole situation; if there were any hope whatever that a statesman
might rise up in Congress and, like Johan Castberg of
Norway, defend a legal measure which would help ordinary
men and women to speak the truth in their personal relationships—if
there were any prospect that any of these influences
would have any weight in the deliberations of Congress, one
might regard the possibilities of Federal action with a gleam
of hope. But since nothing of the kind can be expected, the
best that can happen in regard to divorce in the near future
is for Congress to leave it alone. There is a strong tradition
in the historical suffrage movement of America which favours
liberal divorce laws and which makes it improbable that a
reactionary measure could gain sufficient support from the
feminine electorate. Since the majority of those who seek
divorce in this country are women, it seems to put them logically
on the side of dissoluble marriage.</p>

<p>Though home is a sacred word in America, it is a portable
affair. Migration is a national habit, handed down and still
retained from the days when each generation went out to break
new ground. The disasters of the Civil War sent Southern
families and New England families scurrying to the far West.
The development of the railway and express systems produced
as a by-product a type of family life that was necessarily
nomadic. The men of the railway “Brotherhoods” have
always been marrying men, and their families acquired the art
of living on wheels, as it were. Rich farmers of the Middle
West retire to spend their old age in a California cottage surrounded
by an orange grove—and the young farmers move to
the city. The American family travels on any and every excuse.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
The neurotic pursuit of health has built up large communities
in Colorado, Arizona, and other points West. Whole
families “picked up,” as the saying goes, and set out for the
miraculous climate that was to save one of its members from
the dreaded tuberculosis—and then later had to move again
because somebody’s heart couldn’t stand the “altitude.” The
extreme examples of this nomadic habit are found among the
families of the very poor and the very rich, who have regular
seasonal migrations. The oyster canners and strawberry-pickers
have a mobility which is only equalled by that of the
Palm Beachers. And finally there is the curious practice of
New England which keeps boarders in the summer-time in
order that it may be boarded by Florida in the winter-time.</p>

<p>By contrast with all this geographical instability, the stable
sway of convention and custom stands out impressively. With
each change of environment, family tradition became more
sacred. Unitarians who moved to Kansas were more zealous
in the faith than ever, and F.F.V.’s who settled in Texas were
fiercely and undyingly loyal to the memory of Pocahontas.
Families that were always losing their background, tried to
fixate in some form the ancestral prestige which threatened
always to evaporate. Organizations composed of the Sons
and Daughters of the Revolution, of the descendants of the
Pilgrims, of Civil War Veterans, of the Scions of the Confederacy,
and so on, sprang up and flourished on the abundant soil
of family pride. All of which means that pioneering brought
no spiritual independence or intellectual rebirth, and that new
conditions were anxiously reformulated under the sanction of
the old. Above all, sanction was important. That incredible
institution, the “society column” of the local newspaper, took
up the responsibility where the Past laid it down. Stereotyped
values of yesterday gave way to stereotyped values of to-day.
This was the commercial opportunity of a multitude of home
journals and women’s magazines which undertook—by means
of stories, pictures, and advertisements—to regiment the last
detail of home life. But the perforated patterns, the foods
“shot from guns,” and all the rest of the labour-saving ingenuities
which came pouring into the home and which were supposed
to mean emancipation for mothers and their families,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
brought little of the real spirit of freedom in their wake. Our
materialistic civilization finds it hard to understand that liberty
is not achieved through time-saving devices but only
through the love of it.</p>

<p>But the notorious spoiling of the American child—some one
says—is not that a proper cradle of liberty for the personality?
A spoilt child may be a nuisance, but if he is on the way towards
becoming a self-reliant, self-expressive adult, the
“American way” of bringing up children may have its peculiar
advantages. But a spoilt child is really a babyish child,
and by that token he is on the way towards becoming a childish
adult. Neither is his case disposed of simply by adjudging
him a nuisance; the consequence of his spoiling carry much
further than that. They are seen, for instance, in malnutrition
of the children of the American rich—a fact which has
but recently been discovered and which came as a great surprise
to the experts. “In Chicago,” one of them tells us, “it
was found that a group of foreign children near the stockyards
were only 17 per cent. underweight, while in the all-American
group near the University of Chicago they were 57 per cent.
below normal.” The same condition of things was found in a
select and expensive boarding school in the neighbourhood of
Boston. A pathetic commentary—is it not?—on a country
which leads the world in food-packing and food-profits, that
it should contain so many parents who, with all the resources
of the earth at their command, do not know how to feed their
own children. Surely, the famous American spoiling has
something to do with this. Whether it may not also be behind
the vast amount of mental disturbance in the population may
well be considered. The asylums are suddenly over-crowded.
The National Committee for Mental Hygiene suggests for our
consolation that this may be because the asylums are so much
more humane than they used to be and the families of the
sufferers are more willing than formerly to consign them to
institutions.</p>

<p>It is the fashion to attribute all these mental tragedies to
the strain of business life and industry, and more recently to
war-shock. But if we are to accept the results of the latest
psychological research, the family must receive the lion’s share<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
of blame. The groundwork for fatal ruptures in the adult personality
is laid in childhood and in the home which produced
the victim. For many years the discussion of American nerves
has hinged on the hectic haste of business and industrial life,
on the noise and bustle and lack of repose in the national
atmosphere. But we have neglected to accuse the family to its
face of failing to protect the child against the cataclysms of
the future while it had the chance.</p>

<p>The tremendous influence of the family on the individuals,
old and young, composing it is not merely a pious belief. We
are, alas, what our families make us. This is not a pleasant
thought to many individuals who have learned through bitter
experience to look on family relationships as a form of soul
imprisonment. Yet it seems to be an incontestable fact that
personality is first formed—or deformed—in the family constellation.
The home really does the job for which the school,
the press, the church, and the State later get the credit. It is
a smoothly articulated course from the cradle onward, however,
in which the subjugated parent produces a subjugated child,
not so much by the rod of discipline—which figures very
little in American family life—but by the more powerful and
pervasive force of habit and attitude. Parents allow themselves
to be a medium for transmitting the incessant pressure
of standards which allow no room for impulse and initiative;
they become the willing instrument of a public mania for
standardization which tries to make every human soul into the
image of a folded pattern. The babe is moulded in his cradle
into the man who will drop a sentimental tear, wear a white
carnation, and send a telegram on Mother’s Day—that travesty
of a family festival which shames affection and puts spontaneous
feeling to the blush.</p>

<p>As the family itself grows smaller, this pressure of mechanistic
and conventional standards encroaches more closely upon
the child. A sizeable group of brothers and sisters create for
themselves a savage world which is their best protection against
the civilization that awaits them. But with one or two children,
or a widely scattered series, this natural protection is
lost. The youngster is prematurely assimilated to the adult
world of parents who are nowadays, owing to later marriage, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
even quite so young as formerly they were. It is a peculiarity
of parents, especially of mothers, that they never entertain a
modest doubt as to whether they might be the best of all possible
company for their children. And obviously the tired business
man cannot properly substitute in the evenings for a roistering,
shouting brother who never came into the world at
all; nor can all the concentrated care of the most devoted
mother take the place of the companionship and discipline
which children get from other children. These considerations
deserve more attention than they usually receive in connection
with the falling birth-rate. The figures mean that the environment
of the young child is being altered in a fundamental respect.
Parents of small families need to take effective steps
to counteract the loss. Practical things, like nursery schools,
would be a help. But, chiefly, if parents will insist on being
companions of their children, they need themselves to understand
and practise the art of common joy and happiness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_ALIEN">THE ALIEN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> immigrant alien has been discussed by the Anglo-Saxon
as though he were an Anglo-Saxon “problem.” He
has been discussed by labour as though he were a labour
“problem”; by interpreters of American institutions as though
man existed for institutions and for institutions which the class
interpreting them found advantageous to its class. Occasionally
the alien has been discussed from the point of view of the
alien and but rarely from the point of view of democracy. The
“problem” of the alien is largely a problem of setting our own
house in order. It is the “problem” of Americanizing America.
The outstanding fact of three centuries of immigration
is that the immigrant alien ceases to be an alien when economic
conditions are such as properly to assimilate him.</p>

<p>There is something rather humorous about the way America
discusses “the alien.” For we are all aliens. And what is
less to our liking we are almost all descended from the peasant
classes of Europe. We are here because our forebears were
poor. They did not rule over there. They were oppressed;
they were often owned. And with but few exceptions they
came because of their poverty. For the rich rarely emigrate.
And in the 17th and 18th centuries there was probably a
smaller percentage of immigrants who could pass the literacy
test than there are to-day. Moreover, in the early days only
suffering could drive the poor of Europe from their poverty.
For the conditions of travel were hazardous. The death toll
from disease was very high. It required more fortitude to
cross the Atlantic and pass by the ring of settlers out onto the
unbroken frontier than it does to pass Ellis Island and the
exploiters round about it to-day.</p>

<p>The immigration question has arisen because America, too,
has created a master class, a class which owns and employs and
rules. And the alien in America is faced by a class opinion,
born of the change which has come over America rather than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
any change in the alien himself. America has changed. The
alien remains much the same. And the most significant phase
of the immigration problem is the way we treat the alien and
the hypocrisy of our discussion of the subject.</p>

<p>Sociologists have given us a classification of the immigrant
alien. They speak of the “old immigration” and the “new
immigration.” The former is the immigration of the 17th and
18th and the first three-quarters of the 19th centuries. It was
English, Scotch, Irish, German, Scandinavian with a sprinkling
of French, Swiss, and other nationalities. From the beginning,
the preponderance was British. During the 18th century
there was a heavy Scotch inflow and during the first half
of the 19th a heavy Irish and German immigration. The Irish
came because of the famine of 1848, the Scotch in large part
because of the enclosure acts and the driving of the people from
the land to make way for deer preserves and grazing lands for
the British aristocracy. Most of the British immigration was
the result of oppressive land laws of one kind or another. The
population of Ireland was reduced from eight million to slightly
over four million in three-quarters of a century. The British
immigrant of the 17th century, like the recent Russian immigration,
was driven from home by economic oppression. Only
a handful came to escape religious oppression or to secure
political liberty. The cause of immigration has remained the
same from the beginning until now.</p>

<p>The “old immigration” was from the North of Europe.
It was of Germanic stock. It was predominantly Protestant.
But the most important fact of all and the fact most usually
ignored is an economic fact. The early immigrant found a
broad continent awaiting him, peopled only by Indians. He
became a free man. He took up a homestead. He ceased to
belong to any one else. He built for himself. He paid no
rent, he took no orders, he kept what he produced, and was
inspired by hope and ambition to develop his powers. It was
economic, not political, freedom that distinguishes the “old
immigration” from the “new.”</p>

<p>The “new immigration” is from Southern and Central Europe.
It is Latin and Slavic. It is largely Catholic. It, too,
is poor. It, too, is driven out by oppression, mostly economic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
and for the most part landed. Almost every wave of immigration
has been in some way related to changes for the worse
in the landed systems of Europe. Wherever the poverty has
been the most distressing, there the impulse to move has been
the strongest. It has been the poverty of Europe that has
determined our immigration from the 17th century until now.</p>

<p>The ethnic difference is secondary. So is the religious.
The fundamental fact that distinguishes the “old immigration”
from the “new” is economic. The “new immigration”
works for the “old.” It found the free land all taken up.
The public domain had passed into the hand of the Pacific
railroads, into great manorial estates. Land thieves had repeated
the acts of the British Parliament of the 18th century.
The Westward movement of peoples that had been going on
from the beginning of time came to an end when the pioneer
of the 80’s and 90’s found only the bad lands left for settlement.
That ended an era. It closed the land to settlement
and sent the immigrant to the city. The peasant of Europe
has become the miner and the mill worker. He left one kind
of serfdom to take up another. It is this that distinguishes
the “old immigrant” from the “new.” It is this that distinguishes
the old America from the America of to-day. And the
problem of immigration, like the problem of America, is the
re-establishment of economic democracy. The protective tariff
bred exotic industry. The employer wanted cheap labour.
The mine owners and mill owners combined with the steamship
companies to stimulate immigration. They sent agents
abroad. They brought in gangs from Southern and Central
Europe. They herded them in mining camps, in mill towns,
in the tenements. The closing of the public domain and the
rise of monopoly industry marks the turning point in immigration.
It marks the beginning of the immigration “problem.”
It is partly ethnic, but largely economic.</p>

<p>The “new immigration” from Southern and Central Europe
began to increase in volume about 1890. It came from Southern
rather than Northern Italy, from Poland, Hungary, Bohemia,
Russia, the Balkans, and the Levant. There was a
sprinkling of Spanish and Portuguese immigrants. In 1914
South and Central European immigration amounted to 683,000,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
while the North European immigration was but 220,000. Of
the former 296,000 came from Italy, 123,000 from Poland,
45,000 from Russia, and 45,000 from Hungary. These figures
do not include Jewish immigrants, who numbered 138,000. Of
the North European immigrants 105,000 came from the British
Isles, 80,000 came from Germany, and 36,000 from the
Scandinavian countries.</p>

<p>Of the 14,000,000 persons of foreign birth now in the
country, a very large percentage is of South and Central European
stock.</p>

<p>We are accustomed to think of the old immigration and the
new immigration in terms of races and religions. And much
of the present-day hostility to immigration comes from the
inexplicable prejudice which has recently sprung up against
persons of differing races and religions. It is assumed that the
new immigration is poor and ignorant because it is ethnically
unfitted for anything different and that it prefers the tenement
and the mining camp to American standards of living and culture.
But the newly arrived immigrant goes to the mines and
the crowded city not from choice but from necessity. He lives
in colonies with his fellows largely because the employing
class prefers that he be segregated and has no interest in his
physical comfort or welfare. The alien has been a commodity,
not a human being; he has been far cheaper than a machine
because he provided his own capital cost and makes provision
for his own depreciation and decay. He has been bought in
the slums of Europe for his passage money and he can be left
to starve when bad times or industrial power throws him on
his own resources. The important difference between the “old
immigration” and the “new immigration” is not ethnic. It
is not religious. It is economic. The “old immigration” has
become the owning and employing class, while the “new immigration”
is the servile and dependent class. This is the real,
the important difference between the “old immigration” and
the “new.” The former owns the resources of America. The
economic division coincides roughly with the race division.</p>

<p>When economic privilege becomes ascendant fear is born. It
is born of a subconscious realization on the part of the privileged
classes that their privileges rest on an unjust if not an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
unstable foundation. Fear is the parent of hate, and back of
other explanations of the present demand for exclusion of the
alien is fear. It is fear that gave birth to the persecution
and ruthless official and semi-official activity first against all
aliens under the White Slave Act and similar laws, next against
the Germans, and later against the “reds.” An economic psychology
born of injustice explains our present attitude toward
the alien just as a different economic psychology explained our
attitude during the first two and a half centuries of our life
when it was the consuming desire of statesmen, real-estate speculators,
and exploiters to people the continent and develop our
industries and resources as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>The “immigration problem,” so called, has always been and
always will be an economic problem. There are many people
who feel that there is an inherent superiority in the Anglo-Saxon
race; that it has a better mind, greater virtue, and a
better reason for existence and expansion than any other race.
They insist there are eugenic reasons for excluding immigration
from South and Central Europe; they would preserve
America for people of Anglo-Saxon stock. As an immigration
official I presided over Ellis Island for five years. During this
time probably a million immigrants arrived at the port of New
York. They were for the most part poor. They had that in
common with the early immigrant. They had other qualities
in common. They were ambitious and filled with hope. They
were for the most part kindly and moved by the same human
and domestic virtues as other peoples. And it is to me an
open question whether the “new immigration,” if given a virgin
continent, and the hope and stimulus which springs from
such opportunity, would not develop the same qualities of mind
and of character that we assume to be the more or less exclusive
characteristics of the Anglo-Saxon race. There is also
reason for believing that the warmer temperament, the emotional
qualities, and the love of the arts that characterize the
South and Central European would produce a race blend,
under proper economic conditions, that would result in a better
race than one of pure Northern extraction. For it is to be
remembered that it was not political liberty, religious liberty,
or personal liberty that changed the early immigrant of Northern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
Europe into the American of to-day. His qualities were
born of economic conditions, of a free continent, of land to be
had for the asking, of equal opportunity with his fellows to
make his life what he would have it to be. The old immigrant
recognized no master but himself. He was the equal of his
neighbours in every respect. He knew no inferiority complex
born of a servile relationship. It was this rather than our
constitutions and laws that made the American of the first
three centuries what he was. It was this alchemy that changed
the serf of Northern Europe into the self-reliant freeman of
America.</p>

<p>The immigration problem was born when this early economic
opportunity came to an end. When the free land was
all gone, the immigrant had to work for somebody else. He
went to the mines and the city tenement not from the choice
but from necessity. He took the first job that offered. When
established he sent for his brother, his neighbour, or his friend.
He, too, went to the mining camp or the slum. Colonies appeared.
The alien became segregated. He lived by himself.
And he developed the qualities that would be developed by
any race under similar conditions. He, too, feared. He was
known as a Dago, Wop, Hunkie. To him government meant
a policeman, a health officer, and an immigration inspector—all
agencies to be feared. He slowly learned to unionize. He
came to understand group action. He found in his craft organization
the only protection against the employers, and in
the political boss the only protection against agencies that interfered
with his personal and domestic life. The immigrant
soon learned that our immigration laws were shaped by economic
motives. He learned that he was in danger of being
deported if he did not work. The menace which hangs over
the immigrant during his early years is the phrase “likely to
become a public charge.” And this alleged reason for deportation
covers a multitude of other excuses which can be used
as it is used—as a drag-net accusation. So the immigrant
feels and justly feels that what we want of him is to work, to
work for some one else, and to accept what is offered and be
content. For within the last few years the doctrine has become
accepted by him and by the nation as well that the alien<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
must not complain, he must not be an agitator, he must not
protest against the established industrial order or the place
which he occupies within it. This has heightened his fear complex.
It has tended to establish his inferiority relationship.</p>

<p>Our legislative attitude toward the alien has mirrored the
economic conditions of the country. Up to about the middle
of the last century we had no restrictive laws of any kind.
America was free to all comers. We wanted population.
Western States pleaded for settlers. They drew them from the
East as they drew them from Europe. We were hospitable
to the oppressed. We opened our arms to revolutionary leaders.
We had no fears. Experience had shown that the poorest
of Europe, even the classified criminals of Europe, would
quickly Americanize themselves under the stimulus of new
opportunity in a virgin land where all men were potentially
equal. For generations there was fear that the American continent
could never be fully peopled.</p>

<p>But the free lands were all gone about 1890. The Western
drift of peoples, which had been in movement since the earliest
times, came to an end. Population closed in on the Pacific.
Cities grew with unprecedented rapidity. Factories needed
men. Employers looked to Europe. They sent agents abroad
who employed them in gangs. Often they were used to displace
American-born workers. They were used to break up
labour organizations. The aliens were mixed to prevent them
organizing. Wages were temporarily at least forced down.
For some years our immigration policy was shaped by the
big industrials who combined with the steamship companies to
induce immigration.</p>

<p>Organized labour began to protest. It, too, was moved by
economic motives. It secured the passage of the contract
labour law, which prevents the landing of any worker for whom
employment has been provided in advance by an employer.
Organized labour began to demand restrictive legislation to
protect its standard of living. But the country was not ready
for restrictive legislation. Congress instead adopted a selective
policy. We excluded paupers, the insane and diseased,
criminals, immoral persons, and those who were likely to become
a public charge. Later we extended the selective idea to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
persons who did not believe in organized government, to
anarchists, and to persons of revolutionary beliefs. We now
exclude and deport for opinions as well as for physical and
mental conditions. The percentage of rejections under these
selective laws was not great. Of the 1,200,000 aliens who
came to the country in 1914 only one and one-third per cent.
were denied admission by the immigration authorities.</p>

<p>The war stimulated the anti-alien feeling. It provided an
opportunity for crusades. The press aided the hue and cry.
In 1915 there was a nation-wide round-up of immoral cases.
Thousands of prostitutes, of procurers, and of persons guilty
of some personal irregularity were arrested all over the country.
Many of them were deported. The demand for restrictive
legislation was supported by many different groups. It
had the backing of organized labour, of the Southern States,
of many protestant organization and churches. It was strongly
supported in the West.</p>

<p>The “literacy test,” which went into effect in 1917, requiring
of the alien an ability to read some language selected by him,
was the first restrictive measure enacted. Its purpose was to
check the South and Central European inflow. For in these
countries illiteracy is very high. It rises as high as sixty
and seventy per cent. in the Central European states. With
the test of literacy applied it was felt that the old immigration
from Northern Europe would reassert itself. Our industrial
needs would be supplied from Great Britain, from Germany
and from the Scandinavian countries. The same motive underlies
the recently enacted law which arbitrarily fixes the
number who may come in any one year from any one country
to three per cent. of the aliens already here from that country.
This will still further shift the immigration to the Northern
countries, and if continued as the permanent policy of the Government
will insure a predominant Anglo-Saxon-Germanic-Scandinavian
stock as the racial stock of America.</p>

<p>Despite all of the Congressional concern over the alien and
the recent nation-wide movement for his Americanization, there
has never been any official concern for the alien, for his protection
from exploitation and abuse, or any attempt to work
out a policy of real Americanization. Not that the task is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
impossible. Not that it is even experimental. Australia,
Brazil, and Canada have more or less well-developed agencies
for aiding the alien on landing, for protecting him until he is
able to protect himself, and for adjusting him as speedily as
possible to new conditions of life. In all of these countries
the aim of the government is to give the immigrant a stake
in the land, to bring about his permanent residence in the
country, and, if possible, to induce him to become a farmer
rather than an industrial worker. This has not been done by
agencies of distribution alone, but by conscious selection in the
country from which the immigrant comes, by grants of land
to those who are ready to take up land holdings, and by the
extension of credit from state agencies to enable the settlers
to stock and equip their farms. The policy of Brazil has
been so successful that many colonies of Northern Italians
have been induced to settle there who have become prosperous
and contented farmers. In other words, these countries have
consciously aimed to work out a continuing policy similar to
that which prevailed in this country up to about 1890 when
the immigrant drifted naturally to the land as a means of securing
the freedom from the exploiting class that had driven
him from Europe.</p>

<p>It is not to be inferred that our policy of hands off the alien
after his landing has worked only evil. Viewed in the perspective
of two centuries, it has worked amazingly well. The
rapidity with which practically all immigrants rise in the world
in spite of the obstacles of poverty, illiteracy, and unfamiliarity
with our language is little short of a miracle. This is true of
the older generation as it is of the younger. It is most true
in the cities, least true in the mining camps and smaller industrial
centres about the steel mills and slaughter houses where
the tyranny of the employing class is most pronounced. For
the newcomer speedily acquires the wants of those with whom
he associates. He becomes dissatisfied with his shack. He
demands more and better food and clothes. He almost always
wants his children to have a schooling and to rise in the scale,
which to him means getting out of the hod-carrying, day-labour,
or even artisan class. And the next generation does rise. It
rises only less rapidly than did the early immigrant. It increases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
its wants and demands. It finds the trades union a
weapon with which it can combat the employer who seeks to
bring about a confusion of tongues, a confusion of religion,
and a confusion of races as a means of maintaining the open
shop. As an evidence of this, the Amalgamated Clothing
Workers of America is almost exclusively Jewish, Italian, and
Latin in its membership. It is the most intelligent, the most
social-minded, and the most highly developed labour organization
in the country. The coal miners are largely men of foreign
birth. They, too, have adopted an advanced social programme.
The alien has found the trades union the most efficient
if not the only agency through which he can Americanize
himself. And in Americanizing himself he is merely doing
what the aliens of earlier centuries who preceded him have
done—he is seeking for economic freedom from a master class.</p>

<p>America is a marvellous demonstration of the economic
foundations of all life. It is a demonstration of what happens
to men when economic opportunities call forth their resourcefulness
and latent ability on one hand and when the
State, on the other, keeps its hands off them in their personal
relationships. For the alien quickly adopts a higher standard
of culture as he rises in the industrial scale, while his morals,
whatever they may have been, quickly take on the colour of
his new environment, whatever that may be. And if all of
the elements which should enter into a consideration of the
subject were included, I am of the opinion it would be found
that the morals, the prevalence of vice and crime among the
alien population is substantially that of the economic class in
which he is found rather than the race from which he springs.
In other words, the alleged prevalence of crime among the alien
population is traceable to poverty and bad conditions of living
rather than to ethnic causes, and in so far as it exists it tends
disappear as the conditions which breed it pass away.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that our hands-off policy of the past has
worked amazingly well, the time has come when it must be
changed. Not because of any change in the character of the
alien, but because of the change which has taken place in our
own internal life. Economic conditions make it impossible for
the alien, as it does for the native born, to become a farmer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
Exploiting agencies are making it difficult and often impossible
for the farmer to make a living. Land speculation has shot
up the price of farm land to prohibitive figures. The railroads
and middle men and banking agencies are putting the American
farmer into a semi-servile status. He is unable to market his
crop after it is produced or he markets it at a figure that ultimately
reduces him to bankruptcy. The immigration problem
remains an economic problem. It has become an American
problem. The policy we should adopt for Americanizing the
alien is a policy we should adopt for our own people as well, for
when economic opportunity came to an end for our own people,
it created not only an immigration problem, but a domestic
problem. The solution of one is the solution of the other.</p>

<p>The alien will Americanize himself if he is given the opportunity
to do so. The bird of passage will cease to migrate
when he possesses a stake in the land of his adoption. The
best cure for Bolshevism is not deportation but a home, a farm,
a governmental policy of land settlement. A constructive immigration
policy and Americanization policy is one that will:</p>

<p>1. Direct the alien as well as the native born to opportunities
of employment and especially to agencies that will enable
them to become home owners and farm owners;</p>

<p>2. Provide government grants, as is done in Australia, Denmark,
and some of the South American countries, to which the
would-be farmer or home owner can go for financial assistance.
In Denmark and Australia any man who shows aptitude and
desire for farming and who is able to satisfy a local commission
of his abilities, can secure a small farm in a farm colony, fully
equipped for planting. The grant includes a house and barn,
some cattle and machinery, and sufficient capital to carry the
settler over the first season. The applicant must provide a
certain portion of the initial outlay himself. He is aided by
experts from the colony, he is advised as to what to plant and
how to care for his cattle. His produce is marketed co-operatively,
while much of the machinery is owned either by
the community or by co-operative agencies identified with the
community. The land is purchased in large tracts by the
State in advance of settlement to prevent speculation, while
settlers are required to develop their holdings. They may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
not purchase for speculative purposes. The State of Denmark
has planted thousands of home-owning farmers in this way and
has all but ended farm tenancy in a generation’s time. The
farm tenant and farm labourer have become owners. A similar
policy has been developed in Australia, where millions of
dollars have been advanced by the State to settlers. In both
of these countries the land settlement colonies have been a
great success. There have been few failures and no losses to
the State.</p>

<p>3. The savings of the alien should be used for the benefit
of the alien. Hundreds of millions of dollars leave this country
annually in the form of remittances. Much of it goes abroad
because of fear of American banks. Many millions more are
in hiding for the same reason. The deposits in the Postal
Savings banks are largely the deposits of the immigrant. They
are turned over to the National banks and find their way into
commercial activities. If these funds were mobilized in co-operative
banks, as is done all over Europe, or if the Government
would dedicate them to a revolving fund for aiding
persons to build homes, to buy farms, and to aid the alien with
credit, which he now has no means of securing; he would be
lured from the city to the land, he would become a home and
farm owner rather than an industrial worker, and would rapidly
develop those qualities of mind and character that are associated
in our minds with the early Anglo-Saxon settler but
which are rather the qualities which spring up of themselves
when the economic conditions encourage them.</p>

<p>4. Our deportation laws are a disgrace to any country.
They are an adaptation of the fugitive slave laws. The offending
alien is subject to lynch law sanctioned by the State. He
is arrested on complaint by an inspector. He is then tried by
the man who arrests him. His friends and relatives are excluded
from the trial. The judge who made the arrest is often
the interpreter and the clerk who transcribes the testimony.
He also is his jailer. He can and does hold the alien incommunicado.
Often the alien scarcely knows why he has been
arrested. Often he does not understand the testimony. The
local findings have to be approved at Washington by the Department
of Labour. But the approval is by a clerk who, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
the inspector, often wants to make a record. The opportunity
for collusion with police, with crusaders, with employers, with
Chambers of Commerce, and with organization bent on “ridding
the country of disturbers” is manifest. Often men are
arrested, tried, convicted, and possibly placed on ships for their
home countries before their families are aware of what has
happened to them.</p>

<p>The alien is denied every protection of our constitution.
The Bill of Rights does not apply to him. He has no presentment
before a Grand Jury, there is no jury trial, he rarely has
counsel, and he is often held incommunicado by the official
who has taken him into custody and who wants to justify his
arrest. The only recourse the alien has is the writ of habeas
corpus. But this is of practically no avail. For the courts
have held that if there is a scintilla of evidence on which the
inspector could act the court will not review the finding. And
a scintilla is any evidence at all. When to this is added the
fact that the charge “likely to become a public charge” has
come to cover almost any condition that might arise, and as
this charge is usually added to the others as a recourse on which
the inspector may fall back, the chance of relief in the court
is practically nil. Under the laws as they now exist the alien
is a man without a country. He has no protection from the
constitution and little protection under the laws. The alien
knows this. He feels that he is defenceless. American liberty
to him means the liberty of a policeman, a health or school
official, an immigration inspector, and agents of the department
of justice to invade his home, to seize his papers, to arrest
without warrant, to hold incommunicado, and to deport on a
charge that is often as foreign to the facts as anything could be.</p>

<p>It is this more than anything else that has embittered the
alien towards America during the last few years. It is this
that makes him feel that he is not wanted here. It is this that
is sending hundreds of thousands back to Europe, many of them
among the best of the aliens and many of them worthy in
every way of our confidence and welcome.</p>

<p>A proper immigration policy should be a national policy.
Not something for the alien alone but for our own people.
For the immigration problem is merely another form of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
domestic problem. When we are ready to settle the one we
will settle the other. A cross section of one branch of our
political State is a cross section of another. The alien of
to-day is not very different from the alien of yesterday. He
has the same instincts and desires as did those who came in
the <i>Mayflower</i>. Only those who came in the <i>Mayflower</i> made
their own laws and their own fortunes. Those who come to-day
have their laws made for them by the class that employs
them and they make their own fortunes only as those aliens
who came first permit them to do so.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“... not to laugh at the actions of men, nor yet to deplore or
detest them, but simply to understand them.”—<cite>Spinoza.</cite></p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> America, the race-problem is not only without answer;
thus far it is even without formulation. In the face of ordinary
economic, political, and religious difficulties, people habitually
formulate creeds which give a kind of rhyme and reason
to their actions; but where inter-racial relations are concerned,
the leaders go pussy-footing all around the fundamental question,
while the emotions of the masses translate themselves
into action, and action back again into emotion, with less consideration
of means and ends than one expects of the maddest
bomb-thrower. Everybody has some notion of the millennial
aims of the Communist Party, the National Association of
Manufacturers, the W.C.T.U., the Holy Rollers; but what
are the Southerners getting at, when they educate the Negro,
and refuse him the ballot; what ultimate result does the North
expect from the granting of the franchise and the denial of
social equality? Do both the North and the South hope to
maintain a permanent racial division of the country’s population?
If so, are the Indians, the Jews and the Asiatics to be
classed with the Negroes, as unassimilable minorities? How
is the conduct of the American majority suited to this aim,
if it is an aim? How can permanent division be maintained,
except by permanent prejudice? What do the racial liberators,
ameliorators, uplifters, and general optimists think about it;
or do they think about it at all?</p>

<p>From the moment of initial contact between the mass of
the American population and the country’s most important
racial minorities—the Indian, the Jew, the Oriental, and the
Negro—the self-congratulatory feelings of the majority have
always found a partial or complete counterpart everywhere
except among the slaves and the children of the slaves. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
long delay in the inception of All-Africanism in America, and
the groping uncertainty which still characterizes its manifestations,
are due in large part to the cultural youthfulness of
the American Negro. Biologically, the black race was matured
in Africa; culturally it had made considerable advances
there, before the days of the slave-trade. The process of enslavement
could not strip away the physical characteristics
of the race, but in all that has to do with cultural life and
social inheritance, the Negro was re-born naked in the new
world.</p>

<p>When one compares the condition of the Negro with that
of the other three racial minorities at the moment of contact
with the miscellaneous white population, the Indian seems
closer to the Jew and the Oriental than to the slave. In a
general way, the condition of the Indian tribes resembled that
of the Negroes in Africa, but the Indians were left in possession
of most of the elements of savage culture and were
never entirely deprived of the means of maintaining themselves
in this stage of development. Needless to say, the Jews
and the Orientals were in still better case than the
Indians, for their imported cultural equipment was far more
elaborate and substantial, and their economic position much
better.</p>

<p>The four racial minorities thus varied widely in the degree
of their self-sufficiency, and likewise, inversely, in the degree
of their need for absorption into the current of American life.
Quite obviously the Negro was least independent and most in
need of assimilation. However, the necessity of the alien group
has not been the only factor of importance in this matter of
assimilation. Each of the minorities has been from the beginning
subjected to the prejudice of the majority, and that group
which first lost all life of its own through contact with the
whites has been singled out for the maximum amount of
persecution.</p>

<p>The standard explanation or excuse for race-prejudice is
the theory of the inequality of racial stocks. However, for
all their eagerness to bolster up a foregone conclusion, the
race-patriots have not been able to prove by any sort of evidence,
historical, biological, or psychological, that racial differences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
are not simply indications of unlikeness, rather than
of inherent superiority or inferiority. The anthropologists
are pretty well agreed that physical differences divide mankind
into three major groups, European (including the Jews),
Mongoloid (including the American Indians), and Negroid;
but science has set no definite limit to the respective potentialities
of these groups. In other words, it has remained for race-prejudice
to assume an unproved inferiority, and to devise
all possible measures for making the life of the objectionable
races exactly what it would be, in the absence of interference,
if the assumed inferiority were real.</p>

<p>To accept the term “race-prejudice” as accurately descriptive
of the feelings to which it is usually applied, is to assume
that these feelings originate in race-differences, if not in the
inequality of races. This, however, is still to be proved.
Race-differences are a factor of the situation wherever two
races are in contact, but it is a matter of common knowledge
that the members of two or more racial groups sometimes intermingle
on terms of greatest friendliness. To attribute
“race-prejudice” to race-difference, and to leave race-friendliness
entirely unexplained, is to blind oneself deliberately to
the existence of variable causes which alone can account for
the variable results that appear in the presence of racial
constants. Racial inequality of intelligence, if it actually
exists, is simply one of a number of ever-present race-differences,
and in all these differences taken together one can
find no adequate explanation of the variable phenomenon commonly
called “race-prejudice,” but so designated here only for
the sake of convenience.</p>

<p>Any serious attempt to get at the non-racial causes of “race-prejudice”
in America would necessarily involve the comparison,
point by point, of economic, social, political, and intellectual
conditions in various localities in the United States
with corresponding local conditions in other countries where
the races here in conflict are more nearly at peace. In the
present state of knowledge, the racial theory of race-prejudice
is demonstrably inadequate, while the non-racial theory is an
hypothesis which can neither be proved nor disproved. Such
being the case, the haphazard speculations which follow are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
not offered as a proof of this hypothesis, or as an explanation
of the existence of race-prejudice in America, but simply as a
stimulus to inquiry.</p>

<p>Beginning with these speculations, it may be said that the
goods and opportunities of the material life, unlike those of the
intellectual life, are frequently incapable of division without
loss to the original possessor. On this account, competition
is likely to be particularly keen and vindictive where material
interests are given the foremost place. It is also perhaps
safe to say that the long preoccupation of the American majority
with the development of its material inheritance has
brought to the majority a heavy heritage of materialism. One
may hazard the statement that the prejudice of America’s native
white majority against the Negroes, the Indians, the Jews and
the Asiatics, is now and has always been in some sense attributable
and proportional to the majority’s fear of some action
on the part of the minority which might injure the material
interests of the majority, while the only race-differences which
have had any real importance are those superficial ones which
serve to make the members of the minorities recognizable at
sight. At any rate, an examination of some of the facts that
come most easily to hand shows an interesting coincidence
between the prejudice of the majority and the power of the
minority.</p>

<p>Before the Civil War, the structure of Southern society was
bottomed on slavery, and the fear of any humanization of
the Negro which would make him appear worthy of emancipation
was strong enough to arouse any degree of prejudice,
and any amount of repression. The prejudice of the Southern
white populace as a whole reached its maximum intensity when
emancipation threatened to place the blacks in permanent political
and economic control of certain portions of the South.
Even to-day, fear of the political power of the Negroes, and
perhaps also the over-emphasized fear of black “outrages,”
still acts upon the white population as a unifying force; but
in spite of this fact, class-interests have become plainly visible.
When Black Republicanism had once been driven to cover, the
masters set about rebuilding their privileges upon the foundation
of Negro labour which is still their chief support. Only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
a few Negroes have been able to compete directly for a share
in these privileges, and accordingly most of the fears of the
well-to-do people of the South are anticipatory rather than
immediate.</p>

<p>With the “poor whites,” the case is altogether different.
Here there is no question of keeping the Negro in his place,
for ever since the Emancipation the place of the Negro has
been very much that of the poor white himself, at least in so
far as economic status is concerned. In the view of the white
labourer, the Negro rises too high the moment he becomes a
competitor for a job, and every Negro is potentially just that.
Accordingly, the prejudice of the poorer whites is bitter and
indiscriminate, and is certainly not tending to decrease with
the cityward drift of the Negro population.</p>

<p>With the appearance of Negro workers in large numbers in
Northern industrial centres, race-prejudice has begun to manifest
itself strongly among the white workers. The Northern
masters have, however, shown little tendency to reproduce
the sentiments of their Southern peers, for in the North there
is no fear of political dominance by the blacks, and a supply
of cheap labour is as much appreciated as it is south of the
Line.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that the proportion of Negroes in the
total population of the United States has declined steadily from
15.7 per cent. in 1850 to 9.9 per cent. in 1920, the attitude of
both Northerners and Southerners is somewhat coloured by
the fear that the blacks will eventually overrun the country.
If prejudice had no other basis than this, there would perhaps
be no great difficulty in effecting its cure. As a matter of
course, immigration accounts in part for the increasing predominance
of the white population; but this hardly disposes
of the fact that throughout the South, during the years 1890–1910,
the percentage of native whites of native parentage advanced
in both urban and rural communities. Discussion of
comparative birth-rates also gives rise to numerous alarums
and excursions, but the figures scarcely justify the fears expressed.
Statistics show that, in spite of the best efforts of
the people who attempt to hold the black man down, and then
fear him all the more because he breeds too generously, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
improvement in the material condition of the Negro is operating
inevitably to check the process of multiplication.</p>

<p>If the case of the Negro is complicated in the extreme, that
of the Indian is comparatively simple. Here race-prejudice
has always followed the frontier. As long as the Indian interfered
with the exploitation of the country, the pioneers feared
him, and disliked him cordially. Their feelings worked themselves
out in all manner of personal cruelty, as well as in a
process of wholesale expropriation, but as soon as the tribes
had been cooped up on reservations, the white man’s dislike
for the Indian began to cool off perceptibly. From the beginning,
the Indian interfered with expansion, not as an economic
competitor, but as a military enemy; when the dread
of him as a fighter disappeared, there was no new fear to take
its place. During the years 1910 to 1920 the Indian population
actually decreased 8.6 per cent.</p>

<p>If the Indian has neither shared the privileges nor paid the
price of a generous participation in American life, the Jew
has certainly done both. In every important field of activity,
the members of this minority have proved themselves quite
able to compete with the native majority, and accordingly
the prejudice against them is not confined to any one social
class, but is concentrated rather in those regions where the
presence of Jews in considerable numbers predicates their
competitive contact with individuals of all classes. Although
as a member of one branch of the European racial family,
the Jew is by no means so definitely distinguished by physical
characteristics as are the members of the other minorities
here under discussion, it is nevertheless true that when the
Jew has been identified by his appearance, or has chosen to
identify himself, the anti-Semite takes on most of the airs of
superiority which characterize the manifestations of prejudice
towards the other minorities. Nevertheless, the ordinary run
of anti-Semitic talk contains frequent admissions of jealousy
and fear, and it is safe to say that one must look chiefly to
such emotions, as intensified by the rapid increase of the
Jewish population from 1,500,000 in 1906 to 3,300,000 in
1918, rather than to the heritage of European prejudice, for an
explanation of the growth of anti-Semitism in America. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
inclusion of anti-Semitism with the other types of race-prejudice
here under discussion follows naturally enough from
the fact that the Jew is thought of as primarily a Jew, whatever
the country of his origin may have been, while the Slav,
for instance, is popularly regarded as a Russian, a Pole, a Serb—a
<em>national</em> rather than a <em>racial</em> alien.</p>

<p>Like the Jew, the Oriental has come into the United States
as a “foreigner,” as well as a member of an alien race. The
absence of this special disqualification has not particularly
benefitted the Negro and the Indian, but its presence in the
case of the Japanese has been of considerable service to the
agitators. The prevalent dislike and fear of the new Japan
as a world-power has naturally coloured the attitude of the
American majority toward the Japanese settlers in this country;
but this in itself hardly explains why the Californians,
who were burning Chinamen out of house and home in the
’seventies, are now centring their prejudice upon the Japanese
agriculturist. The fact is that since the passage of the Exclusion
Laws the Chinese population of the United States has
fallen off more than 40 per cent., and the importance of
Chinese competition has decreased accordingly, while on the
other hand the number of Japanese increased 53.9 per cent.
between 1910 and 1920, and the new competitors are showing
themselves more than a match for the white farmers. With a
frankness that neither Negrophobia nor anti-Semitism has
made us familiar with, many of the Californians have rested
their case against the Japanese on an economic foundation, and
have confessed that they are unable to compete with the
Japanese on even terms. As a matter of course, there is the
usual flow of talk about the inferiority of the alien race, but
the fear of competition, here so frankly admitted, would be
enough in itself to account for this new outbreak of “race-prejudice.”</p>

<p>When one considers thus the course that prejudice has taken
in the case of the Negro, the Indian, the Jew, and the Oriental,
it begins to appear that this sentiment may wax and wane and
change about astonishingly in the presence of racial factors
that remain always the same. Such being the case, one is
led to wonder what the attitude of the native majority would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
be, if the minorities were recognizable simply as groups, but
<em>not</em> as <em>racial</em> groups. In other words, what would be the
result if the racial factor were reduced simply to recognizability?
The question has a more than speculative interest.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>If the causes of race-prejudice lie quite beyond the reach
of any simple explanation, the manifestation of this prejudice
on the part of the American majority are perhaps capable of
an analysis which will render the whole situation somewhat
more comprehensible. By and large, and with all due allowance
for exceptions, it may be said that, in its more familiar
manifestations, race-prejudice takes a direction exactly opposite
to that taken by prejudice against the ordinary immigrant
of European stock; in the former case, a conscious effort is
made to magnify the differences between the majority and the
minority, while in the latter, a vast amount of energy is expended
in the obliteration of these differences. Thus race-prejudice
aspires to preserve and even to increase that degree
of unlikeness which is its excuse for being, while alien-prejudice
works itself out of a job, by “Americanizing” the immigrant
and making him over into an unrecognizable member of the
majority. On one hand, enforced diversity remains as a
source of friction, while on the other, enforced uniformity is
demanded as the price of peace.</p>

<p>Although no purpose can be served by cataloguing here
all the means employed in the South to keep the black man in
his place, a few examples may be cited, in order to show the
scope of these measures of repression. In the economic field,
there is a pronounced tendency to restrict Negro workers to
the humblest occupations, and in the agricultural areas the
system of peonage or debt-slavery is widely employed for the
purpose of attaching Negro families to the soil. Residence-districts
are regularly segregated, Jim Crow regulations are
everywhere in force, and inter-racial marriages are prohibited
by law in all the States of the South. The administration of
justice is in the hands of white judges and white juries, and
the Negro’s chances in such company are notoriously small.
In nearly one-fourth of the counties of the South, the population
is half, or more than half black, but the denial of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
ballot excludes the Negroes from local, State, and national
political activities. In religious organizations, segregation is
the invariable rule. Theatres and even public libraries are
regularly closed to the Negro, and in every State in the South
segregation in schools is prescribed by law. Some idea of
the significance of the latter provision may be drawn from
O. G. Ferguson’s study of white and Negro schools in Virginia.
In this comparatively progressive State, the general
rating of the white schools is 40.8, as against 22.3 for the
coloured schools, the latter figure being seven points lower
than the lowest general rating for any State in the Union.</p>

<p>Such are some of the legal, extra-legal, and illegal manifestations
of that prejudice which finds its supreme expression in
the activities of the lynching-mob and the Ku Klux Klan.
There is still a considerable annual output of lynchings in this
country (in 1920 the victims numbered sixty-five, of whom fifty
were Negroes done to death in the South), but the casualty-list
for the South and for the country as a whole has decreased
steadily and markedly since 1889, and the proportion of Negro
victims who were accused of rape or attacks on women has also
decreased, from 31.8 per cent. in 1889–1893 to 19.8 per cent.
in 1914–1918.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Ku Klux Klan has now re-commenced
its ghost-walking activities under the command of an “Imperial
Wizard” who claims that he has already enlisted 100,000
followers in the fight to maintain the “God-ordained” pre-eminence
of the Anglo-Saxon race in America. Other statements
from the lips of the Wizard seem to indicate that his
organization is not only anti-African, but anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic,
and anti-Bolshevik as well. Indeed, the bearers of
the fiery cross seem bent upon organizing an all-American hate
society, and the expansion of the Klan in the North is already
under way.</p>

<p>However, the Klansmen might have succeeded in carrying
the war into the enemy’s country even without adding new
prejudices to their platform. There has always been some
feeling against the Negro in the North, and the war-time migration
of the blacks to Northern industrial centres certainly
has not resulted in any diminution of existing prejudice. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
National Urban League estimates that the recent exodus from
Dixie has produced a net increase of a quarter of a million in
the coloured population of twelve cities above the Line. This
movement has brought black and white workers into competition
in many industries where Negroes have hitherto been
entirely unknown, and frequently the relations between the
two groups have been anything but friendly. Since about half
the “internationals” affiliated with the American Federation
of Labour still refuse to accept Negro members, the unions
themselves are in no small part to blame for the use that employers
have made of Negro workers as strike-breakers.</p>

<p>In twelve Northern and Western States there are laws on the
statute-books prohibiting marriage between whites and blacks.
Jim Crow regulations are not in force north of Maryland, but
in most of the cities there has been a continuous effort to maintain
residential segregation, and the practice of discrimination
in hotels and restaurants is the rule rather than the exception.
Lynchings are infrequent, but the great riots of Washington
and Chicago were not exactly indicative of good feeling between
the races. One situation which revealed a remarkable
similarity of temper between the North and the South was that
which arose in the army during the war. It is notorious that
Northerners in uniform fell in easily with the Southern spirit,
and gave all possible assistance in an energetic Jim-Crowing of
the Negroes of Michigan and the Negroes of Mississippi, from
the first day of their service right through to the last.</p>

<p>The treatment of the Negro in literature and on the stage
also reveals an unconscious but all the more important
unanimity of opinion. It is true the North has produced no
Thomas Dixons, but it is also true that the gentle and unassuming
Uncle Tom of Northern song and story is none other
than the Uncle Remus whom the South loves so much. In
Boston, as in Baton Rouge, the Negro who is best liked is the
loyal, humble, and not too able mammie or uncle of the good
old days before the war. If an exception be made in the case
of Eugene O’Neill’s “Emperor Jones,” it may be said that
American literature has not yet cast a strong, upstanding black
man for any other rôle than that of beast and villain.</p>

<p>And yet all these forms of discrimination and repression are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
not fully expressive of the attitude of the white population.
The people of the South are fully sensible of the necessity
of keeping the Negro in his place; still they do not keep
him from attending school. Educational facilities, of a sort,
are provided, however reluctantly, and in half the States of
the South school attendance is even made compulsory by laws
(which may or may not be enforced). The schooling is not
of a kind that will fit the Negroes for the permanent and contented
occupancy of a servile position. Generally speaking,
the coloured children do not receive a vocational education that
will keep them in their place, but an old-style three-R training
that prepares for nothing but unrest. If unrest leads to
urbanization, the half-hearted education of the Negro perhaps
serves the interests of the new industrialists; but these industrial
employers are so few in number that their influence cannot
outweigh that of the planters who lose their peons, and the
poor whites who find the Negro with one grain of knowledge
a somewhat more dangerous competitor than the Negro with
none. Hence there is every reason to believe that if the white
South had rationalized this situation, the Negro would be as
ruthlessly excluded from the school as he now is from the
ballot-box. In fact, the education of the Negro seems quite
inconsistent with race-prejudice as it is generally preached
and practised in the South.</p>

<p>In the North there is no discrimination in the schools, and
black children and white are put through the same mill. In
the industrial field, prejudice cannot effectually close to the
Negroes all those openings which are created by general economic
conditions, and in politics the Northern Negro also finds
some outlet for his energies.</p>

<p>While it would be quite impossible to show that the existence
of these miscellaneous educational, industrial, and political
opportunities is due to any general desire upon the part of the
members of the white majority to minimize the differences between
themselves and the Negroes, it is certainly true that this
desire exists in a limited section of the white population. At
the present time, white friends of the Negro are actively engaged
in efforts to eliminate certain legal and illegal forms of
discrimination and persecution, and are giving financial support<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
to much of the religious work and most of the private
educational institutions among the blacks. The Inter-racial
Committee of the War Work Council of the Y.M.C.A. has
listed thirty-three social and economic agencies, and twenty-three
religious agencies, in which members of both races are
working co-operatively. It must be admitted, however, that
many, if not most, of the white participants in work of this
sort are affected by race-prejudice to the extent that they desire
simply to ameliorate the lowly condition of the Negro, without
altogether doing away with a certain wholesome degree of
racial segregation. For the complete elimination of the flavour
of condescension, one must usually seek out those extreme
socialist and syndicalist agitators who preach political or non-political
class-organization, as a substitute for the familiar
national and racial groupings.</p>

<p>In the case of the American Indian, the prejudice and self-interest
of the white majority have placed the emphasis on
geographic rather than social segregation. Here the demand
of the whites has been for land rather than for labour, and
by consequence servility has never been regarded as a prime
virtue of Indian character.</p>

<p>If the early white settlers had so desired, they of course
could have enslaved a considerable portion of the Indian population,
just as the Spaniards did, in regions farther to the
southward. However, the Americans chose to drive the Indians
inland, and to replace them in certain regions with
African tribesmen who in their native state had been perhaps
as war-like as the Indians themselves. Thus in the natural
course of events the African warrior was lost in the slave, while
the Indian chief continued to be the military opponent rather
than the economic servant of exploitation, and eventually
gained romantic interest by virtue of this fact. The nature
of this operation of debasement on one hand, and ennoblement
on the other, is plainly revealed in American literature.
The latter phase of the work is carried forward to-day with
great enthusiasm by the Camp Fire Girls and the Boy Scouts,
whose devotion to the romantic ideal of Indian life is nowhere
paralleled by a similar interest in African tribal lore.</p>

<p>If the Indian has been glorified by remote admirers, he has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
also been cordially disliked by some of his nearest neighbours,
and indeed the treatment he has received at the hands of the
Government seems to reflect the latter attitude rather than
the former. In theory, most of the Indian reservations are
still regarded as subject principalities, and the Indians confined
within their boundaries are almost entirely cut off from
the economic, social, and political life of the neighbouring
white communities. Many of the tribes still receive yearly
governmental grants of food, clothing, arms, and ammunition,
but these allowances only serve to maintain them in a condition
of dependence, without providing any means of exit from
it. In justice it should be said, however, that the Government
has declared an intention to make the Indian self-supporting,
and accordingly it restricts the grants, in principle,
to the old and the destitute. Several States have shown their
complete sympathy with the system of segregation by enacting
laws prohibiting the inter-marriage of Indians and whites.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the mental and moral Americanization of
the red man has been undertaken by Protestant and Catholic
missions, and more recently by Government schools. The
agencies of the latter sort are especially systematic in their
work of depriving the Indian of most of the qualities for which
he has been glorified in romance, as well as those for which
he has been disliked by his neighbours. Many a Western town
enjoys several times each year the spectacle of Indian school-boys
in blue uniforms and Indian school-girls in pigtails and
pinafores, marching in military formation through its streets.
As long as these marchers are destined for a return to the
reservation, the townsmen can afford to look upon them with
mild curiosity. The time for a new adjustment of inter-racial
relations will not come until the procession turns towards the
white man’s job on the farm and in the factory—if it ever
does turn that way.</p>

<p>Attention has already been called to the fact that the
Jewish immigrant normally marches from the dock directly
to the arena of economic competition. Accordingly his progress
is not likely to be at any time the object of mere curiosity.
On the other hand, the manifestations of prejudice against the
Jew have been less aggressive and much less systematic than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
those repressive activities which affect the other minorities.
Where anti-Semitism is present in America, it seems to express
itself almost entirely in social discrimination, in the narrow
sense. On the other hand, economic, political, and educational
opportunities are opened to the Jews with a certain
amount of reluctance. A major exception to this rule of discrimination
must be made in the case of those socialists, syndicalists
and trade-unionists who have diligently sought the
support of the Jewish workers.</p>

<p>The Chinaman has also some friends now among the people
who once regarded him as the blackest of villains. Indeed,
the Californian’s attitude toward the Orientals has in it an
element of unconscious irony which somewhat illuminates the
character of the race-problem. The average Easterner will
perhaps be surprised to learn that in Western eyes the Chinaman
is an inferior, of course, but nevertheless an honest man,
noted for square dealing and the prompt payment of his debts,
while the Jap is a tricky person whom one should never trust
on any account.</p>

<p>In California the baiting of the Japanese is now almost
as much a part of political electioneering as is the abuse of
the Negro in the South. The Native Sons of the Golden West
and the American Legion have gone on record in determined
opposition to any expansion of Japanese interests in California,
while the Japanese Exclusion League is particularly
active in trouble-making propaganda. Economic discrimination
has taken statutory form in the Alien Land Laws of 1913
and 1920; discriminatory legislation of the same general type
has been proposed in Texas and Oregon; a bill providing for
educational segregation has been presented for a second time
at Sacramento; Congress has been urged to replace the “gentlemen’s
agreement” with an absolute prohibition of Japanese
immigration; and there is even a demand for a constitutional
amendment which will deny citizenship to the American-born
children of aliens who are themselves ineligible for naturalization.
The method of legislation is perhaps preferable to the
method of force and violence, but if the previous history of
race-prejudice means anything, it means that force will be
resorted to if legislation fails. At bottom, the spirit of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
California Land Laws is more than a little like that of a
Georgia lynching; in the one case as in the other, the dominant
race attempts to maintain its position, not by a man-to-man
contest, with fair chances all around, but by depositing
itself bodily and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</i> on top of the subject people and
crushing them.</p>

<p>If in the realm of individual conduct this sort of behaviour
works injury to the oppressor, as well as to the oppressed, it is
not otherwise where masses of men are concerned. Stephen
Graham, in his recent book, “The Soul of John Brown,” says
that “in America to-day, and especially in the South, there is
a hereditary taint left by slavery, and it is to be observed in
the descendants of the masters as much as in the descendants
of the slaves. It would be a mistake to think of this American
problem as exclusively a Negro problem.” Indeed, it is true
that in every case the race-problem is the problem of the
majority as well as of the minority, for the former can no
more escape the reaction of prejudice than the latter can escape
its direct effects.</p>

<p>To-day the white South is still under the influence of a system
of life and thought that is far more enduring than the one
institution which gave it most complete expression. The
Emancipation abolished slavery, but it did not rid the master
of the idea that it is his right to live by the labour of the
slave. The black man is not yet relieved of the duty of supporting
a certain proportion of the white population in leisure;
nor does it appear that the leisured Southerner of to-day makes
a better use of his time than his ancestors did before him.
Indeed, an historian who judged the peoples chiefly by their
contribution to science and the arts would still be obliged to
condemn the white South, not for enslaving the Negro, but
for dissipating in the practices of a barren gentility the leisure
that Negro labour created, and still creates, so abundantly.
It is notorious also that in the South the airs of gentility have
been more widely broadcast among the white population than
the leisure necessary for their practice, with the result that
much honest work which could not be imposed upon the
black man has been passed on to posterity, and still remains
undone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span></p>

<p>Any one who seeks to discover the cause of the mental
lethargy that has converted the leisure of the South so largely
into mere laziness must take some account of a factor that is
always present where race-prejudice exists. The race which
pretends to superiority may not always succeed in superimposing
itself economically upon the inferior group; and yet the
pride and self-satisfaction of the members of the “superior”
race will pretty surely make for indolence and the deadening
of the creative spirit. This will almost inevitably be true where
the superiority of the one race is acknowledged by the other,
and where no contest of wits is necessary for the maintenance
of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">status quo</i>. This is the condition that has always obtained,
and still obtains in most of the old slave territory. In
Dixie it is a career simply to go through life inside of a
white skin. However ignorant and worthless the white man
may be, it is still his privilege to proclaim on any street corner
that he is in all respects a finer creature than any one of several
million human beings whom he classes all together as
“good-for-nothin’ niggers.” If the mere statement of this
fact is not enough to bring warm applause from all the blacks
in the neighbourhood, the white man is often more than willing
to use fire and sword to demonstrate a superiority which
he seldom stoops to prove in any other fashion. Naturally this
feeling of God-given primacy tends to make its possessors indolent,
immune to new ideas of every sort, and quite willing
to apply “the short way with the nigger” to any one who
threatens the established order of the universe.</p>

<p>It would be foolish indeed to suppose that the general intolerance,
bigotry, and backwardness which grow out of race-prejudice
have affected the South alone. The North and the
West have their prejudices too, their consciousness of a full-blooded
American superiority that does not have to be proved,
their lazy-mindedness, their righteous anger, their own short
way with what is new and strange. No sane man will attribute
the origin of all these evils to race-prejudice alone, but no
honest man will deny that the practice of discrimination against
the racial minorities has helped to infect the whole life and
thought of the country with a cocky and stupefying provincialism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span></p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting phase of the whole racial situation
in America is the attitude which the minorities themselves
have maintained in the presence of a dominant prejudice which
has constantly emphasized and magnified the differences between
the minorities and majority, and has even maintained
the spirit of condescension, and the principle of segregation
in such assimilative activities as education and Christian mission
work. One would naturally expect that such an attitude
on the part of the majority would stimulate a counter race-prejudice
in each of the minorities, which would render them
also intent upon the maintenance of differentiation.</p>

<p>Although such a counter prejudice has existed from the beginning
among the Indians, the Jews, and the Asiatics, it is
only now beginning to take form among the Negroes. The
conditions of the contact between the black minority and the
white majority have thus been substantially different from
those which existed in the other cases, and the results of this
contact seem to justify the statement that, so long as it remains
<em>one-sided</em>, the strongest race-prejudice cannot prevent the cultural
and even the biological assimilation of one race to another.
In other words, prejudice defeats itself, in a measure,
just so long as one of the parties accepts an inferior position;
in fact, it becomes fully effective only when the despised group
denies its own inferiority, and throws the reproach back upon
those with whom it originated. Thus the new racial self-consciousness
of a small section of the Negro population gives
the prejudiced whites a full measure of the differentiation they
desire, coupled with an absolute denial of the inferiority which
is supposed to justify segregation.</p>

<p>It has already been pointed out that the enslavement of
the Negroes deprived them of practically everything to which
racial pride might attach itself, and left them with no foundation
of their own on which to build. Thus they could make
no advances of any sort except in so far as they were permitted
to assimilate the culture of the white man. In the natural
course of events, the adoption of the English language came
first, and then shortly the Negro was granted such a share
in the white man’s heaven as he has never yet received of the
white man’s earth. As the only available means of self-expression,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
religion took a tremendous hold upon the slaves,
and from that day to this, the black South has wailed its heart
out in appeals to the white man’s God for deliverance from the
white man’s burden. The Negro “spirituals” are not the
songs of African tribesmen, the chants of free warriors. Indeed,
the white man may claim full credit for the sadness that
darkens the Negro’s music, and put such words as these into
the mouth of the Lord:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Go down, Moses,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Way down in Egyp’ lan’</div>

    <div class="verse indent4">Oppres’ so hard dey could not stan’,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Le’ ma people go!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When casual observers say that the black man is naturally
more religious than the white, they lose sight of the fact that
the number of church-members per thousand individuals in the
Negro population is about the same as the average for the
United States as a whole; and they forget also the more important
fact that the Negro has never had all he wanted of
anything except religion—and in segregated churches at that.
It is more true of the black men than of Engel’s proletarians,
that they have been put off for a very long time with checks
on the bank of Heaven.</p>

<p>Emancipation and the Fourteenth Amendment seemed to
open the path to an earthly paradise; but this vision was soon
eclipsed by a second Civil War that resulted in a substantial
victory for the white South. Economic repression could not
be made entirely effective, however, and in the fifty-three years
from 1866 to 1919 the number of American Negro homeowners
increased from 12,000 to 600,000 and the number of
Negroes operating farms from 20,000 to 1,000,000. In 1910
the Negro population still remained 72.6 per cent. rural, but
the cityward movement of the blacks during the years 1890
to 1910 was more rapid than that of the whites. Education has
directly facilitated economic progress, and has resulted in an
increase of literacy among the Negroes from ten per cent. in
1866 to eighty per cent. in 1919. During the period 1900 to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
1910, the <em>rate</em> of increase of literacy among the blacks was
much more rapid than that among the whites. Thus from the
day he was cut off from his own inheritance, the American
Negro has reached out eagerly for an alien substitute, until
to-day, in practically everything that has to do with culture,
he is not black but white—and artificially retarded.</p>

<p>Since America has deprived the Negro of the opportunity to
grow up as an African, and at the same time has denied him
the right to grow up as a white man, it is not surprising that
a few daring spirits among the Negroes have been driven at
last to the conclusion that there is no hope for their race
except in an exodus from the white man’s culture and the
white man’s continent. The war did a great deal to prepare
the way for this new movement; the Negroes of America heard
much talk of democracy not meant for their ears; their list
of wrongs was lengthened, but at the same time their economic
power increased; and many of them learned for the first time
what it meant to fight back. Some of them armed themselves,
and began to talk of taking two lives for one when the lynching-mob
came. Then trouble broke in Chicago and Washington—and
the casualties were not all of one sort. Out of this welter
of unrest and rebellion new voices arose, some of them calling
upon the Negro workers to join forces with their white
brothers; some fierce and vengeful, as bitterly denunciatory
of socialism and syndicalism as of everything else that had
felt the touch of the white man’s hand; some intoxicated,
ecstatic with a new religion, preaching the glory of the black
race and the hope of the black exodus.</p>

<p>With much travail, there finally came forth, as an embodiment
of the extreme of race-consciousness, an organization
called the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African
Communities League. This clan lays claim to a million
members in the United States, the West Indies, South America
and South Africa, and announces as its final object the establishment
of a black empire in Africa. Connected with the
U.N.I.A. are the Black Star Line, capitalized at $10,000,000,
and the Negro Factories Corporation, capitalized at $2,000,000.
Just what these astonishing figures mean in actual cash it is
impossible to say, but this much is certain: the Black Star Line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
already owns three of the many vessels which—say the
prophets of the movement—will some day ply among the Negro
lands of the world.</p>

<p>To cap the climax, the U.N.I.A. held in New York City
during the month of August, 1920, “the first International
Negro Convention,” which drew up a Negro Declaration of
Independence, adopted a national flag and a national anthem,
and elected “a Provisional President of Africa, a leader for
the American Negroes, and two leaders for the Negroes of
the West Indies, Central and South America.”</p>

<p>The best testimony of the nature of this new movement is
to be found in an astonishing pamphlet called the “Universal
Negro Catechism,” and issued “by authority of the High
Executive Council of the Universal Negro Improvement Association.”
In this catechism one discovers such items as the
following, under the head of “Religious Knowledge”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Q. Did God make any group or race of men superior to another?</p>

<p>A. No; He created all races equal, and of one blood, to dwell on all

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span></p>

<p>Perhaps enough has already been said to make it clear that
there exists in America no distinctive black culture which could
spontaneously give rise to such a movement as this. Culturally
the black man is American; biologically he is African.
It is solely and entirely the prejudice of the American majority
that has forced this group of Negroes to attempt to reconstruct
a cultural and sentimental connection that was destroyed
long ago. The task which faces the leaders of the new movement
is one of almost insurmountable difficulty, for in spite
of every sort of persecution, the general life and thought of
America are still far more easily accessible to the Negro than
is anything distinctively his own.</p>

<p>The cultural shipwreck of the Negro on the American shore
has thus placed him more completely at the mercy of the
majority than the other minorities have ever been. In the
case of the Indians, the Jews, and the Orientals, the race-name
has not stood simply for an incomplete Americanism, but for
a positive cultural quality which has persisted in the face of
all misfortune. These races were provisioned, so to speak, for
a long siege, while the Negro had no choice but to eat out of
the white man’s hand, or starve.</p>

<p>The reservation-system has reduced many of the Indian
tribes to a state of economic dependence, but it has also helped
to preserve their cultural autonomy. In most cases the isolated
communities on the reservations are distinctly Indian
communities. The non-material inheritance of the past has
come down to the present generation in a fairly complete form,
with the result that the Indian of to-day may usually take his
choice between Indian culture and white. Under these conditions
the labours of missionaries and educators have not been
phenomenally successful, as is witnessed by the fact that the
number of Protestant Christians per thousand Indians is still
only about one-seventh as large as that for the Negroes, while
the percentage of illiterates is much larger among the Indians.
However, school attendance is increasing at a more rapid rate
than among the whites, and the prospect is that the Government
schools will eventually deprive the country of all that is
attractive in Indian life.</p>

<p>Toward the close of the 19th century, the Indian’s resentment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
of the white man’s overbearing actions found expression
in a religious movement which originated in Nevada and spread
eastward till it numbered among its adherents nearly all the
natives between the Rocky Mountains and the Missouri River.
This messianic faith bore the name of a ceremonial connected
with it, the Ghost Dance, and was based upon a divine revelation
which promised the complete restoration of the Indian’s
inheritance. Such doctrines have, of course, been preached in
many forms and in many lands, but it is no great compliment
to the amiability of American civilization that the gospel of
deliverance has found so many followers among the Negroes,
the Indians, and the Jews who dwell within the borders of the
country.</p>

<p>It does not seem likely that the Zionist version of this gospel
will produce any general exodus of the last-named minority
from this country, for in spite of prejudice, the Jews have been
able to make a large place for themselves in the United States.
Since the movements of the Jews have not been systematically
restricted, as those of the Negroes and the Indians have
been, the great concentration of the Jewish population in the
cities of the East would seem to be due in large measure to the
choice of the Jews themselves. At the present time they dominate
the clothing industry, the management of the theatre, and
the production of motion-pictures. Approximately one-tenth
of the trade-unionists in the United States are Jews, and the
adherence of a considerable number of Jews to the doctrines
of socialism and syndicalism has unquestionably been one of
the causes of prejudice against the race.</p>

<p>In matters that pertain more directly to the intellectual life,
the Jews have exhibited every degree of eagerness for, and
opposition to, assimilation. There are among them many
schools for the teaching of the Hebrew language, and some
other schools—private and expensive ones—in which only non-Jewish,
“all-American” teachers are employed. Of the
seventy-eight Jewish periodicals published in the United States,
forty-eight are printed in English. In every Jewish centre,
Yiddish theatres have been established for the amusement of
the people; but Jewish managers, producers, actors, and playwrights
have also had a large part in the general dramatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
activities of the country. Finally, in the matter of religion,
the response of the Jews to Christian missionary work has
been very slight indeed, while, on the other hand, the number
of synagogue-members per thousand Jews is only about one-fourth
the general average of religious affiliation for the United
States as a whole. When one considers the fact that in some
fields the Jews have thus made advances in spite of opposition,
while in others they have refused opportunities offered to them,
it seems at least probable that the incompleteness of their
cultural assimilation is due as much to their own racial pride
as to the prejudice of the majority.</p>

<p>Similarly in the case of the Orientals, the pride and self-sufficiency
of the minority has helped to preserve for it a measure
of cultural autonomy. In the absence of such a disposition
on the part of the Chinese, it would be difficult to account for
the fact that their native costume has not disappeared during
the thirty-nine years since the stoppage of immigration. San
Francisco’s Chinatown still remains very markedly Chinese
in dress largely because the Chinese themselves have chosen
to keep it so. The Japanese have taken much more kindly to
the conventional American costume, but one is hardly justified
in inferring from this that they are more desirous for general
assimilation. Indeed, one would expect the opposite to be
the case, for most of the Japanese in America had felt the
impress of the nationalistic revival in Japan before their departure
from that country. In a measure this accounts for the
fact that Japanese settlers have established a number of Buddhist
temples and Japanese-language schools in the United
States. However, figures furnished by the “Joint Committee
on Foreign Language Publications,” which represents a number
of Evangelical denominations, seem to indicate that the
Japanese in the United States are much more easily Christianized
than the Chinese, and are even less attached to Buddhism
than are the Jews to their native faith. In the nature of
things, the domestic practice of Shinto-worship among the
Japanese is incapable of statistical treatment.</p>

<p>Thus the combination of all the internal and external forces
that affect the racial minorities in America has produced a
partial, but by no means a complete, remodelling of minority-life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
in accordance with standards set by the majority. Prejudice
and counter-prejudice have not prevented this change,
and there is no accounting for the condition of the American
minorities to-day without due attention to the positive factor
of cultural assimilation, as well as to the negative factor of
prejudice.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Since it has already been implied that a greater or less assimilation
by the minorities of the culture of the majority is
inevitable, it is apparent that the relation of this assimilative
change to the biological fusion of the groups is a matter of
ultimate and absolute importance. Wherever friction exists
between racial groups, the mere mention of biological fusion is
likely to stir up so much fire and smoke that all facts are
completely lost to sight; and yet it is quite obvious that the
forces of attraction and repulsion which play upon the several
races in America have produced biological as well as cultural
results.</p>

<p>The mulatto population of the United States is the physical
embodiment of a one-sided race-prejudice. By law, by custom,
even by the visitation of sudden and violent death, the
master-class of the South expresses a disapproval of relations
between white women and coloured men, which does not apply
in any forcible way to similar relations between white men
and coloured women. The white male is in fact the go-between
for the races. The Negroes have not the power,
and sometimes not even the will, to protect themselves against
his advances, and the result is that illegitimate mulatto children
in great numbers are born of Negro mothers and left to
share the lot of the coloured race.</p>

<p>If the infusion of white blood were stopped entirely, the
proportion of mulattoes in the Negro race would nevertheless
go on increasing, since the children of a mulatto are usually
mulattoes, whether the other parent be mulatto or black.
There is, however, no reason for supposing that under such
conditions the proportion of mulattoes to blacks would increase
<em>more</em> rapidly in one geographic area than in another. The
fact is that during the period 1890 to 1910 the number of
mulattoes per 1,000 blacks <em>decreased</em> in the North from 390<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
to 363, and <em>increased</em> in the South from 159 to 252; the inference
as to white parenthood is obvious. During the same
period the black population of the entire United States increased
22.7 per cent., while the mulatto population increased
81.1 per cent. The mulatto group is thus growing far more
rapidly than either the black or the white, and the male white
population of the South is largely responsible for the present
expansion of this class, as well as for its historical origin.</p>

<p>Thus the South couples a maximum of repression with a
maximum of racial intermixture; indeed, the one is naturally
and intimately associated with the other. The white population
as a whole employs all manner of devices to keep the
Negro in the social and economic status most favourable to
sexual promiscuity, and aggressive white males take full advantage
of the situation thus created.</p>

<p>While it is not generally admitted in the South that the progressive
whitening of the black race is a natural result of the
maintenance of a system of slavery and subjection, the converse
of this proposition is stated and defended with all possible
ardour. That is to say, it is argued that any general improvement
in the condition of the Negro will increase the likelihood
of racial intermixture on a higher level, through inter-marriage.
The Southerners who put forth this argument know very well
that inter-marriage is not likely to take place in the presence
of strong race-prejudice, and they know, too, that the Negro
who most arouses their animosity is the “improved” Negro
who will not keep his place. They are unwilling to admit
that this increase in prejudice is due largely, if not wholly,
to the greater competitive strength of the improved Negro;
and likewise they prefer to disregard the fact that such a Negro
resents white prejudice keenly, and tends to exhibit on his own
part a counter prejudice which in itself acts as an additional
obstacle to inter-marriage.</p>

<p>In the absence of such factors as Negro self-consciousness
and inter-racial competition, it would be difficult to account for
the extreme rarity of marriages between blacks and whites in
the Northern States. No comprehensive study of this subject
has been made, but an investigation conducted by Julius
Drachsler has shown that of all the marriages contracted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
Negroes in New York City during the years 1908 to 1912, only
0.93 per cent. were mixed. The same investigation revealed
the fact that Negro men contracted mixed marriages about four
times as frequently as Negro women.</p>

<p>Marriages between whites and Indians have not been so
vigorously condemned by the American majority as those
between whites and Negroes, and the presumption is that the
former have been much more frequent. However, it appears
that no systematic investigation of Indian mixed marriages
has been made, and certainly no census previous to that of
1910 gives any data of value on the subject of mixed blood
among the Indians. The enumeration of 1910 showed that
56.5 per cent. of the Indians were full-blooded, 35.2 per cent.
were of mixed blood, and 8.4 per cent. were unclassified. Although
it is impossible to fix the responsibility as definitely
here as in the case of the Negro, it is obvious that an infusion
of white blood half again as great as that among the Negroes
cannot be accounted for in any large part by racial inter-marriages.
Without question, it is chiefly due to the same
sort of promiscuity that has been so common in the South, and
the present and potential checks upon the process of infusion
are similar to those already discussed.</p>

<p>In the case of the Jews and the Asiatics, it seems that the
only figures available are those gathered by Drachsler. He
found that only 1.17 per cent. of the marriages contracted
by Jews in New York City during the years 1908 to 1912 were
classifiable as “mixed,” while the corresponding percentages
for the Chinese and the Japanese were 55.56 and 72.41
respectively. The largeness of the figures in the case of Orientals
is accounted for in part by the fact that there are comparatively
few women of Mongolian race in New York City.
Besides this, it must be remembered that, whatever the degree
of their cultural assimilation, the Chinese and Japanese residents
of the metropolis are not sufficiently numerous to form
important competitive groups, while the Jews constitute one-quarter
of the entire population of the city. Does any one
doubt that the situation in regard to mixed marriages would be
partially reversed in San Francisco?</p>

<p>When due allowance is made for special conditions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
Drachsler’s figures do not seem to run contrary to the general
proposition that an improvement in the economic and social
condition of one of the minorities, and a partial or complete
adoption by the minority of the culture of the majority, does
not necessarily prepare the way for racial fusion, but seems to
produce exactly the opposite effect by increasing the competitive
power of the minority, the majority’s fear of its rivals, and
the prejudice of each against the other.</p>

<p>In spite of all that prejudice can do to prevent it, the economic,
social, and intellectual condition of the minorities is
becoming increasingly like that of the majority; and yet it is
not to be expected that as long as the minorities remain physically
recognizable this change will result in the elimination of
prejudice, nor is it likely that the cultural assimilation which
checks the process of racial intermixture through promiscuous
intercourse will result automatically in intermixture on a higher
level, and the consequent disappearance of the recognizability
of the minorities. Prejudice does not altogether prevent cultural
assimilation; cultural assimilation increases competitive
strength without eliminating recognizability; competitive
strength <em>plus</em> recognizability produces more prejudice; and so
on ... and so on.... Thus it seems probable that race-prejudice
will persist in America as long as the general economic,
social, political, and intellectual system which has nurtured
it endures. No direct attack upon the race-problem, as
such, can alter this system in any essential way.</p>

<p>Is this conception sound, or not? It stands very high upon
a slim scaffolding of facts, put together in pure contrariness
after it had been stated that no adequate foundation for such
a structure could be found anywhere. But, after all, it is no
great matter what happens to the notion that race-prejudice
can be remedied only incidentally. If the conditions which
surround race-prejudice are only studied comparatively, this
notion and others like it will get all the attention they deserve.</p>

<h3><i>RACE PROBLEMS</i></h3>

<p>(The answers are merely by way of suggestion, but the questions
may prove to be worthy of serious attention.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Q. Has the inherent inferiority of any human race been established
by historical, biological or psychological evidence?</p>

<p>A. No.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Q. Does the theory of the inequality of human races offer a satisfactory
explanation of the existence of race-prejudice?</p>

<p>A. No.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Q. Do physical characteristics make the members of the several
races recognizable?</p>

<p>A. Yes.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Q. Is race-prejudice inherent and inevitable, in the sense that it
always exists where two recognizably different races are in contact?</p>

<p>A. No.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Q. How does it happen that in the presence of <em>racial</em> factors which
remain constant, race-prejudice exists in some localities, and is absent
in others?</p>

<p>A. No satisfactory explanation of these local variations in inter-racial
feeling has yet been given; however, the existence of the variations
themselves would seem to indicate that the primary causes of race-prejudice
are <em>not racial</em> but <em>regional</em>.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Q. What study will lead most directly to an understanding of race-prejudice—that
of universal racial differences, or that of regional environmental
differences which are associated with the existence and non-existence
of racial prejudice?</p>

<p>A. The latter.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Q. Does the systematic study of regional environmental differences in
the United States, in their relation to race-prejudice, yield any results
of importance?</p>

<p>A. No such systematic study has ever been made; a casual glance
seems to reveal an interesting coincidence between race-prejudice and the
fear of competition.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Q. Is competition more likely to produce race-prejudice in the
United States than elsewhere?</p>

<p>A. Because of the general preoccupation of the American people with
material affairs, <em>economic</em> competition is likely to produce unusually
sharp antagonisms.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Q. Does the coincidence between race-prejudice and the fear of competition
offer a complete explanation of the existence and strength of
race-prejudice in the United States?</p>

<p>A. No; no such claim has been advanced.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Q. Is the assimilation by the minorities of the culture of the majority
taking place continuously, in spite of the prejudice of the majority and
the counter-prejudice of three of the minorities?</p>

<p>A. Yes.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Q. Does this cultural assimilation make for better inter-racial feeling?</p>

<p>A. Probably not, because as long as physical race-differences remain,
cultural assimilation increases the strength of the minority as a <em>recognizable</em>
competitive group, and hence it also increases the keenness of the
rivalry between the minorities and the majority.</p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
<p>Q. How can the recognizability of the minorities be eliminated?</p>

<p>A. By blood-fusion with the majority.</p>

<p>Q. How can blood-fusion come about if cultural assimilation increases
rivalry and prejudice?</p>

<p>A.  ............................... .</p>

<p>Q. Is it then true that, as things stand, the future of inter-racial
relations in the United States depends upon the ratio between cultural
assimilation, which seems inevitable, and biological assimilation, which
seems unlikely?</p>

<p>A. It so appears.</p>

<p>Q. Does the race-problem in the United States then seem practically
insoluble as a separate problem?</p>

<p>A. It does.</p>

<p>Q. Has the race-problem ever been solved anywhere by direct attack
upon it as a <em>race</em> problem?</p>

<p>A. Probably not.</p>

<p>Q. Does not this conclusion involve a return to the assumption that
race-prejudice is inevitable wherever race-differences exist; and has this
not been emphatically denied?</p>

<p>A. On the contrary, the implication is that race-prejudice is inevitable
where <em>race-prejudice</em> exists. The conclusion in regard to the United
States is based on the single assumption that the <em>non-racial</em> conditions
under which race-prejudice has arisen will remain practically unchanged.</p>

<p>Q. Is it then conceivable that a complete alteration of non-racial
conditions—as, for instance, an economic revolution which would change
the whole meaning of the word “competition”—might entirely revise the
terms of the problem?</p>

<p>A. It is barely conceivable—but this paper is not an accepted channel
for divine revelation.</p>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Do</span> I understand you to say that you do not believe in advertising?
Indeed! Soon you will be telling me that you
do not believe in God. Though, to be sure, in so doing you
would be committing less of a crime against the tenets of modern
American civilization than in doubting the existence of a
power so great that overnight it can raise up in our midst gods,
kings, and other potentates, creating a world which for splendour
and opulence far surpasses our own poor mortal sphere—a
world in which every prospect pleases and only the reluctant
spender is vile.</p>

<p>True, we can only catch a fleeting glimpse of its many marvels.
True, we have scarcely time to admire a millionth part
of the joys and magnificence of one before a new and greatly
improved universe floats across the horizon, and, from every
corner news-stand, smilingly bids us enter its portals. True,
I repeat, our inability to grasp or appreciate the full wonder
of these constantly arriving creations, yet even the narrow
limitations of our savage and untutored minds can hardly
prevent us from acclaiming a miracle we fail to understand.</p>

<p>If it were only given me to live the life led by any one of
the fortunate creatures that dwell in these advertising worlds,
I should gladly renounce my home, my wife, and my evil ways
and become the super-snob of a mock creation. All day long
should I stand smartly clad in a perfectly fitting union-suit just
for the sport of keeping my obsequious butler waiting painfully
for me with my lounging-gown over his exhausted arm. On
other days I should be found sitting in mute adoration before
a bulging bowl of breakfast food, and, if any one should chance
to be listening at the keyhole, they might even catch me in the
act of repeating reverently and with an avid smile on my lips,
“I can never stir from the table until I have completely
crammed myself with Red-Blooded American Shucks,” adding
in a mysterious whisper, “To be had at all good grocers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span></p>

<p>There would be other days of course, days when I should
ride in a motor of unrivalled power with companions of unrivalled
beauty, across canyons of unrivalled depth and mountains
of unrivalled height. Then would follow still other days,
the most perfect days of all, days when the snow-sheathed earth
cracks in the clutches of an appalling winter and only the lower
classes stir abroad. This would be the time that I should
select for removing the lounging gown from my butler’s arm
and bask in the glowing warmth of my perfect heater, with my
chair placed in such a position as to enable me to observe the
miserable plight of my neighbours across the way as they strive
pitifully to keep life in their bodies over the dying embers of
an anæmic fire. The sight of the sobbing baby and haggard
mother would only serve to intensify my satisfaction in having
been so fortunate and far-sighted as to have possessed myself of
a Kill Kold Liquid Heat Projector—That Keeps the Family
Snug.</p>

<p>What days I should spend! Take the literary days, for
instance. Could anything be more edifying than to dip discriminatingly
into a six-inch bookshelf with the absolute assurance
that a few minutes spent thus each day in dipping would,
in due course of time, give me complete mastery of all the best
literature of the world—and incidentally gain for me a substantial
raise at the office? Nor could any of the literature
of the past ages equal my hidden library of books containing
Vital Secrets. In this room there would linger a never-failing
thrill. Here I should retreat to learn the secret of success,
the secret of salesmanship, the secret of vigour, the secret of
bull-dozing one’s boss, the secret of spell-binding, the secret of
personality and social charm, all bearing a material value measured
in dollars and cents. In time I should so seethe with
secrets that, unable to bear them any longer, I should break
down before my friends and give the whole game away.</p>

<p>But why should I lacerate my heart in the contemplation of
happiness I shall never experience? Why should I dwell upon
the pipe-filling days, or the days when I should send for samples?
Why torture my mind with those exquisitely tailored
days when, with a tennis racket in one hand and a varsity crew
captain on my shoulder, I should parade across the good old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
campus in a suit bereft of wrinkles and a hat that destroyed
the last shreds of restraint in all beholding women? No, I
can go no further.</p>

<p>For when I consider the remarkable characters that so
charmingly infest my paradise never found, I cannot help asking
myself, “How do they get that way?” How do the men’s
legs grow so slim and long and their chins so smooth and
square? Why have the women always such perfect limbs and
such innocent but alluring smiles? Why are families always
happy and children always good? What miracle has banished
the petty irritations and deficiencies of life and smoothed out
the problems of living? How and why—is there an answer?
Can it all be laid at the door of advertising, or do we who
read, the great, sweltering mass of us, insist upon such things
and demand a world of artificial glamour and perfectly impossible
people? The crime is committed by collusion, I am
forced to conclude. Advertising, for the most part, makes
its appeal to all that is superficial and snobbish in us, and we
as a solid phalanx are only too glad to be appealed to in such
a manner.</p>

<p>In only the most unscholarly way can I lay my reflections
before you, and the first one is this: advertising is America’s
crudest and most ruthless sport, religion, or profession, or
whatever you choose to call it. With an accurate stroke, but
with a perverted intent, it coddles and toys with all that is base
and gross in our physical and spiritual compositions. The
comforts and happiness it holds out to the reader are for ever
contrasted with the misery and misfortune of another. Thus,
if I ride in a certain make of motor, I have the satisfaction
of knowing that every one who rides in a motor of another
make is of a lower caste than myself and will certainly eat dust
for the rest of his life. There is a real joy in this knowledge.
Again, if I wear a certain advertised brand of underwear, I
have the pleasure of knowing that my fellow-men not so fortunately
clad are undoubtedly foolish swine who will eventually
die of sunstroke, after a life devoted entirely to sweating.
Here, too, is a joy of rare order. If I brush my teeth with
an advertised tooth paste, my satisfaction is enhanced by the
knowledge that all other persons who fail to use this particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
paste will in a very short time lose all of their teeth. In this
there is a savage, but authentic delight. Even if I select a
certain classic from my cherished six-inch bookshelf, I shall
have a buoyant feeling in knowing that all men, who, after the
fatigue of the day, take comfort in the latest murder or ball-game,
are of inferior intellect and will never succeed in the
world of business.</p>

<p>This is one of the most successful weapons used in advertising,
and there is no denying that a great majority of people
take pleasure in being struck by it. It is a pleasure drawn
from the same source that feeds so many people’s sense of satisfaction
when they attend a funeral, or call on a sick friend,
or a friend in misfortune and disgrace. It was the same source
of inner satisfaction which made it possible for many loyal
citizens to bear not only with fortitude, but with bliss, the sorrows
of the late war. It is the instinct of self-preservation,
toned down to a spirit of complacent self-congratulation, and
it responds most readily to the appeal of selfishness and snobbery.
Advertising did not create this instinct, nor did it discover
it, but advertising uses it for its own ends. Who is to
blame, the reader or the advertiser, hardly enters in at this
point. The solid fact to take into consideration is that day
in and day out the susceptible public is being worked upon in
an unhealthy and neurotic manner which cannot fail to effect
harmful results.</p>

<p>At this tragic moment I purpose briefly to digress to the
people who create advertisements, before returning to a consideration
of the effects of their creations.</p>

<p>To begin with, let it never be forgotten that advertising is
a red-blooded, two-fisted occupation, engaged in for the most
part by upstanding Americans of the kiss-the-flag or knock-’em-down-and-drag-’em-out
variety. Yet years of contact with
the profession compel me for the sake of truth to temper this
remark by adding that it also contains, or rather confines,
within its mystic circle a group of reluctant and recalcitrant
“creatures that once were men,” who, moving through a phantasmagoria
of perverted idealism, flabby optimism, and unexamined
motives, either deaden their conscience in the twilight
of the “Ad. Men’s Club,” or else become so blindly embittered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
or debauched that their usefulness is lost to all constructive
movements.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, however, advertising is the graveyard
of literary aspiration in which the spirits of the defeated aspirants,
wielding a momentary power over a public that rejected
their efforts, blackjack it into buying the most amazing
assortment of purely useless and cheaply manufactured commodities
that has ever marked the decline of culture and common
sense. These men are either caught early after their
flight from college, or else recruited from the newspaper world.
Some—the most serious and determined—are products of correspondence
schools. Others are merely robust spirits whose
daily contact with their fellow-men does not give them sufficient
opportunity to disgorge themselves of the abundance of
misinformation that their imaginations manufacture in wholesale
quantities. This advertising brotherhood is composed of
a heterogeneous mass of humanity that is rapidly converted
into a narrow-minded wedge of fanatics. And this wedge is
continually boring into the pocketbook of the public and extracting
therefrom a goodly quantity of gold and silver. Have
you ever conversed with one of the more successful and important
members of this vast body? If so have you been able
to quit the conversation with an intelligent impression of its
subject-matter? For example: do you happen to know what
a visualizer is? If not, you would be completely at the mercy
of a true advertising exponent. Returning to my Edisonian
method of attack, do you happen to know by any chance what
a rough-out man is, or what is the meaning of dealer mortality,
quality appeal, class circulation, or institutional copy? Probably
not, for there is at bottom very little meaning to them;
nevertheless, they are terms that are sacred to a great number
of advertising men, and which, if unknown, would render
all intelligent communication with them quite impossible.</p>

<p>If you should ever attend a session of these gentlemen in full
cry—and may God spare you this—you would return from it
with the impression that all was not well with the world. You
would have heard speeches on the idealism of meat-packing,
and other kindred subjects. The idealism would be transmitted
to you through the medium of a hireling of some large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
packing organization, a live-wire, God-bless-you, hail-fellow
type. Assuming that you had been there, you would have witnessed
this large fellow with a virile exhalation of cigar-smoke,
heave himself from his chair; you would have observed a good-natured
smile play across his lips, and then you would have
suddenly been taken aback by the tenderly earnest and masterfully
restrained expression that transformed our buffoon into
a suffering martyr, as, flinging out his arms, he tragically exclaimed,
“Gentlemen, you little know the soul of the man who
has given the Dreadnought Ham to the world!” From this
moment on your sense of guilt would have increased by leaps
and bounds until at last you would have broken down completely
and agreed with everything the prophet said, as long
as he refrained from depriving you of an opportunity to make
it up to the god-like man who gave Dreadnought Hams to the
world.</p>

<p>The orator would go on to tell you about the happiness
and sunlight that flood the slaughter-house in which Dreadnought
Hams are made. You would hear about the lovely,
whimsical old character, who, one day, when in the act of
polishing off a pig, stood in a position of suspended animation
with knife poised above the twitching ear of the unfortunate
swine, and seizing the hand of the owner as he
passed benevolently by, kissed it fervently and left on it a
tear of gratitude. Perhaps you would not hear that in the
ardour of loyal zeal this lovable old person practically cut the
pig to ribbons, thus saving it from a nervous collapse, nor
would you be permitted to hear a repetition of the imprecations
the old man muttered after the departing back of the owner,
for these things should not be heard,—in fact, they do not exist
in the world of advertising. Nothing would be said about the
red death of the pig, the control of the stock-raiser, the underpaying
of the workers, the daughter who visits home when
papa is out and the neighbours are not looking, the long years
of service and the short shrift of age, the rottenness and hypocrisy
of the whole business—no, nothing should be said
about such things. But to make up for the omission, you
would be told in honied words of the workers who lovingly
kiss each ham as it is reverently carried from the plant to receive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
the patriarchal blessing of the owner before it is offered
up as a sacrifice to a grateful but greedy public. The whole
affair would suggest to you a sort of Passion Play in which
there was neither Judas nor Pilot, but just a great, big happy
family of ham producers.</p>

<p>This speech, as I have said, would soon appear in the principal
papers of the country. It would be published in installments,
each one bearing its message of peace on earth, good-will
to men, and the public—always preferring Pollyanna to
Blue Beard—would be given an altogether false impression
of Dreadnought Hams, and the conditions under which they
were produced. But this particular speech would be only a
small part of the idealism you would be permitted to absorb.
There would also be a patriotic speech about Old Glory, which
would somehow become entangled with the necessity for creating
a wider demand for a certain brand of socks. There
would perhaps be a speech on the sacredness of the home,
linked cunningly with the ability of a certain type of talking-machine
to keep the family in at nights and thus make the
home even more sacred. There would be speeches without
end, and idealism without stint, and at last every one would
shake hands with every one else and the glorious occasion
would come to an end only to be repeated with renewed vigour
and replenished optimism on the following Friday.</p>

<p>But the actual work of creating advertisements is seldom
done in this rarefied and rose-tinted atmosphere; it is done in
the more prosaic atmosphere of the advertising agency. (And
let it be said at once that although, even in the case of agencies
engaging in “Honest Advertising” campaigns, many such
firms indulge in the unscrupulous competitive practice of splitting
their regular commission with their clients in order to
keep and secure accounts, there are still honest advertising
agencies.)</p>

<p>Now there are two important classes of workers in most
agencies—the copy-writer and the solicitor—the man who
writes the advertisements and the man who gets the business.
This latter class contains the wolves of advertising, the restless
stalkers through the forests of industry and the fields of trade.
They are leather-lunged and full-throated; death alone can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
save their victims from hearing their stories out. Copywriters,
on the other hand, are really not bad at heart; sometimes
they even possess a small saving spark of humour, and
frequently they attempt to read something other than <cite>Printer’s
Ink</cite>. But the full-fledged solicitor is beyond all hope. Coming
in close touch with the client who usually is an industrialist,
capitalist, stand-patter, and high-tariff enthusiast, the solicitor
gradually becomes a small edition of the man he serves, and
reflects his ideas in an even more brutal and unenlightened
manner. In their minds there is no room for change, unless it
be change to a new kind of automobile they are advertising, for
new furniture, unless it be the collapsible table of their latest
client, for spring cleaning, unless thereby one is introduced to
the virtues of Germ-Destroying Soap. Things must remain as
they are and the leaders of commerce and industry must be
protected at all costs. To them there are no under-paid workers,
no social evil, no subsidized press, no restraint of free
speech, no insanitary plants, no child-labour, no infant mortality
due to an absence of maternity legislation, no good strikers,
and no questionable public utility corporations. Everything is
as it should be, and any one who attempts to effect a change is
a socialist, and that ends it all.</p>

<p>Advertising is very largely controlled by men of this
type. Is it any wonder that it is of a reactionary and artificial
nature, and that any irresponsible promoter with money
to spend and an article to sell, will find a sympathetic and wily
minister to execute his plans for him, regardless of their effect
on the economic or social life of the nation?</p>

<p>Turning, for the moment, from the people who create advertisements
to advertising as an institution, what is there to be
said for or against it? What is there to advance in justification
of its existence, or in favour of its suppression? Not
knowing on which side the devil’s advocate pleads his case, I
shall take the liberty of representing both sides, presenting as
impartially as possible the cases for the prosecution and defence
and allowing the reader to bring in the verdict in accordance
with the evidence.</p>

<p>The first charge—that the low state of the press and the
magazine world is due solely to advertising—is not, I believe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
wholly fair. There is no use denying that advertising is responsible
for the limitation of free utterance and the nonexistence
of various independent and amusing publications.
However, assuming that advertising were utterly banished from
the face of the earth, would the murky atmosphere be cleared
thereby? Would the press become free and unafraid, and
would the ideal magazine at last draw breath in the full light
of day? I think not. Years before advertising had attained
the importance it now enjoys, public service corporations and
other powerful vested interests had found other and equally
effective methods of shaping the news and controlling editorial
policies. The fact remains however, and it is a sufficiently
black one, that advertising is responsible for much of
the corruption of our papers and other publications, as well as
for the absence of the type of periodicals that make for the
culture of a people and the enjoyment of good literature.
When a profiteering owner of a large department store can
succeed in keeping the fact of his conviction from appearing
in the news, while a number of smaller offenders are held up
as horrid examples, it is not difficult to decide whether or not
it pays to advertise. When any number of large but loosely
conducted corporations upon which the people and the nation
depend, can prevent from appearing in the press any information
concerning their mismanagement, inefficiency, and extravagance,
or any editorial advocating government control, one
does not have to ponder deeply to determine the efficacy of
advertising. When articles or stories dealing with the unholy
conditions existing in certain industries, or touching on the risks
of motoring, the dangers of eating canned goods, or the impossibility
of receiving a dollar’s value for a dollar spent in a
modern department store, are rejected by many publications,
regardless of their merit, one does not have to turn to the back
pages of the magazine in order to discover the names and products
of the advertisers paying for the space. Indeed, one of
the most regrettable features of advertising is that it makes
so many things possible for editors who will be good, and so
many things impossible for editors who are too honest and too
independent to tolerate dictation.</p>

<p>Another charge against advertising is that it promotes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
encourages the production of a vast quantity of costly
articles many of which duplicate themselves, and that this
over-production of commodities, many of them of highly
questionable value, is injurious to the country and economically
unsound. This charge seems to be well founded
in fact, and illustrated only too convincingly in the list
of our daily purchases. Admitting that a certain amount of
competition creates a stimulating and healthy reaction, it still
seems hardly reasonable that a nation, to appear with a clean
face each morning, should require the services of a dozen
producers of safety razors, and several hundred producers of
soap, and that the producers of razors and soap should spend
millions of dollars each year in advertising in order to remind
people to wash and shave. Nor does it seem to be a well-balanced
system of production when such commodities as automobiles,
sewing machines, face powders, toilet accessories, food
products, wearing apparel, candy, paint, furniture, rugs, tonics,
machinery, and so on <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad infinitum</i> can exist in such lavish
abundance. With so many things of the same kind to choose
from, there is scarcely any reason to wonder that the purchasing
public becomes addle-brained and fickle. The over-production
of both the essentials and non-essentials of life is indubitably
stimulated by advertising, with the result that whenever
business depression threatens the country, much unnecessary
unemployment and hardship arises because of an over-burdened
market and an industrial world crowded with moribund
manufacturing plants. “Give me a strong enough motor and
I will make that table fly,” an aviator once remarked. It could
be said with equal truth, “Give me money enough to spend in
advertising and I will make any product sell.” Flying tables,
however, are not nearly so objectionable as a market glutted
with useless and over-priced wares, and an army of labour dependent
for its existence upon an artificially stimulated demand.</p>

<p>The claim that advertising undermines the habits of thrift
of a nation requires no defence. Products are made to be sold
and it is the principal function of advertising to sell them regardless
of their merits or the requirements of the people. Men
and women purchase articles to-day that would have no place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
in any socially and economically safe civilization. As long as
this condition continues, money will be drawn out of the savings
accounts of the many and deposited in the commercial
accounts of the few—a situation which hardly makes for happy
and healthy families.</p>

<p>It has been asserted by many that advertising is injurious to
literary style. I am far from convinced that this charge is true.
In my belief it has been neither an injurious nor helpful influence.
If anything, it has forced a number of writers to say
a great deal in a few words, which is not in itself an undesirable
accomplishment. Nor do I believe that advertising has recruited
to its ranks a number of writers or potential writers
who might otherwise have given pearls of faith to the world.
However, if it has attracted any first-calibre writers, they have
only themselves to blame and there is still an opportunity for
them to scale the heights of literary eminence.</p>

<p>The worst has been said of advertising, I feel, when we agree
that it has contributed to the corruption of the press, that it
does help to endanger the economic safety of the nation, and
that, to a great extent, it appeals to the public in a false and
unhealthy manner. These charges certainly are sufficiently
damaging. For the rest, let us admit that advertising is more
or less like all other businesses, subject to the same criticisms
and guilty of the same mistakes. Having admitted this, let us
assume the rôle of the attorney for the defence and see what
we can marshal in favour of our client.</p>

<p>First of all, I submit the fact that advertising has kept many
artists alive—not that I am thoroughly convinced that artists
should be kept alive, any more than poets or any other un-American
breed; but for all that I appeal to your humanitarian
instincts when I offer this fact in support of advertising,
and I trust you will remember it when considering the
evidence.</p>

<p>In the second place, advertising is largely responsible for
the remarkable strides we have taken in the art of typography.
If you will examine much of the literature produced by advertising,
you will find there many excellent examples of what can
be done with type. To-day no country in the world is producing
more artistic and authentic specimens of typography than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
America, and this, I repeat, is largely due to the influence of
advertising.</p>

<p>We can also advance as an argument in favour of advertising
that it has contributed materially to a greater use of the
tooth-brush and a more diligent application of soap. Advertising
has preached cleanliness, preached frantically, selfishly
and for its own ends, no doubt, but nevertheless it has preached
convincingly. It matters little what means are used to achieve
the end of cleanliness as long as the end is achieved. This,
advertising has helped to accomplish. The cleanliness of the
body and the cleanliness of the home as desirable virtues are
constantly being held up before the readers of papers and
magazines. As has been said, there are altogether too many
different makes of soap and other sanitary articles, but in this
case permit us to modify the statement by adding that it is
much better to have too many of such articles than too few.
This third point in favour of advertising is no small point to
consider. The profession cannot be wholly useless, if it has
helped to make teeth white, faces clean, bodies healthy, homes
fresh and sanitary, and people more concerned with their
bodies and the way they treat them.</p>

<p>The fourth point in favour of advertising is that through the
medium of paid space in the papers and magazines certain
deserving movements have been able to reach a larger public
and thus recruit from it new and valuable members. This
example illustrates the value of advertising when applied to
worthy ends. In all fairness we are forced to conclude, that,
after all, there is much in advertising that is not totally
depraved.</p>

<p>Now that we are about to rest the case, let us gaze once more
through the magic portals of the advertising world and refresh
our eyes with its beauty. On second glance we find there is
something strangely pathetic and wistfully human about this
World That Never Was. It is a world very much after our
own creation, peopled and arranged after our own yearnings
and desires. It is a world of well regulated bowels, cornless
feet, and unblemished complexions, a world of perfectly fitting
clothes, completely equipped kitchens, and always upright and
smiling husbands. To this world of splendid country homes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
humming motors, and agreeable companions, prisoners on our
own poor weary world of reality may escape for a while to
live a few short moments of unqualified comfort and happiness.
Even if they do return from their flight with pockets empty
and arms laden with a number of useless purchases, they have
had at least some small reward for their folly. They have
dwelt and sported with fascinating people in surroundings of
unsurpassed beauty. True, it is not such a world as Rembrandt
would have created, but he was a grim old realist, who,
when he wanted to paint a picture of a person cutting the nails,
selected for his model an old and unscrupulous woman, and
cast around her such an atmosphere of reality that one can
almost hear the snip of the scissors as it proceeds on its revolting
business. How much better it would be done in the advertising
world! Here we would be shown a young and beautiful
girl sitting gracefully before her mirror and displaying just
enough of her body to convince the beholder that she was
neither crippled nor chicken-breasted, and all day long for ever
and for ever she would sit thus smiling tenderly as she clipped
the pink little moon-flecked nails from her pink little pointed
fingers.</p>

<p>Yes, I fear it is a world of our own creation. Only a few
persons would stand long before Rembrandt’s crude example,
while many would dwell with delight on the curves and allurements
of the maid in the advertising world. Of course one
might forget or never even discover what she was doing, and
assuming that one did, one would hardly dwell upon such an
unromantic occupation in connection with a creature so fair
and refined as this ideal young woman; but for all that, one
would at least have had the pleasure of contemplating her loveliness.</p>

<p>So many of us are poor and ill-favoured in this world of
ours, so many girls are not honestly able to purchase more than
one frock or one hat a year, that the occasion of the purchase
takes on an importance far beyond the appreciation of the
average well-to-do person. It is fun, therefore, to dwell upon
the lines and features of a perfectly gowned woman and to
imagine that even though poor and ill-favoured, one might
possibly resemble in a modified way, the splendid model, if one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
could only get an extra fifteen minutes off at lunch-time in
order to attend the bargain sale. There are some of us who
are so very poor that from a great distance we can enjoy without
hope of participation the glory and triumph of others. The
advertising world supplies us with just this sort of vicarious enjoyment,
and, like all other kinds of fiction, enables us to play
for a moment an altogether pleasing rôle in a world of high
adventure.</p>

<p>Therefore let us not be too uncharitable to the advertising
world. While not forgetting its faults, let us also strive to remember
its virtues. Some things we cannot forgive it, some
things we would prefer to forget, but there are others which
require less toleration and fortitude to accept when once they
have been understood.</p>

<p>As long as the printed word is utilized and goods are bought
and sold, there will be a place and a reason for advertising—not
advertising as we know it to-day, but of a saner and more
useful nature. He would be a doughty champion of the limitation
of free speech who would deny a man the right to tell
the world that he is the manufacturer of monkey-wrenches,
and that he has several thousands of these same wrenches on
hand, all of which he is extremely anxious to sell.</p>

<p>Advertising, although a precocious child, is but in its infancy.
In spite of its rapid development and its robust constitution, it
has not yet advanced beyond the savage and bragging age. It
will appeal to our instincts of greed as quickly as to our instincts
of home-building. It will make friends with the snob
that is in us, as readily as it will avail itself of the companionship
of our desire to be generous and well-liked. It will frighten
and bulldoze us into all sorts of extravagant purchases with
the same singleness of purpose that it will plead with our self-respect
in urging us to live cleaner and better lives. It will use
our pride and vanity for its own ends as coolly as it will use our
good nature or community spirit. It will run through the whole
gamut of human emotions, selecting therefrom those best suited
to its immediate ends. Education alone will make the child
behave—not the education of the child so much as the education
of the reader.</p>

<p>Advertising thrives to-day in the shadows created by big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
business, and, as a consequence, if it would retain its master’s
favour it must justify his methods, and practise his evil ways.
Here it must be added that there are some honest advertising
agencies which refuse to accept the business of dishonest concerns.
It must also be added that there are some magazines
and newspapers which will refuse to accept unscrupulous advertisements.
These advertisements must be notoriously unscrupulous,
however, before they meet this fate. There are
even such creatures as honest manufacturers, but unfortunately
for the profession they too rarely advertise. As a whole, advertising
is committed to the ways of business, and as the ways
of business are seldom straight and narrow, advertising perforce
must follow a dubious path. We shall let it rest at that.</p>

<p>We have made no attempt in this article to take up the subject
of out-door advertising. There is nothing to say about
this branch of the profession save that it is bad beyond expression,
and should be removed from sight with all possible haste.
In revolting against the sign-board, direct action assumes the
dignity of conservatism, and although I do not recommend an
immediate assault on all sign-boards, I should be delighted if
such an assault took place. Were I a judge sitting on the case
of a man apprehended in the act of destroying one of these eyesores,
I should give him the key to my private stock, and adjourn
the court for a week.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BUSINESS">BUSINESS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Modern</span> business derives from three passions in this order,
namely: The passion for things, the passion for
personal grandeur and the passion for power. Things are multiplied
in use and possession when people exchange with each
other the products of specialized labour. Personal grandeur
may be realized in wealth. Gratification of the third passion
in this way is new. Only in recent times has business become
a means to great power, a kind of substitute for kingship,
wherein man may sate his love of conquest, practise private
vengeance, and gain dominion over people.</p>

<p>These passions are feeble on the Oriental side of the world,
strong in parts of Europe, powerful in America. Hence the
character of American business. It is unique, wherein it is so,
not in principle but in degree of phenomena. For natural reasons
the large objects of business are most attainable in this
country. Yet this is not the essential difference. In the pursuit
of them there is a characteristic American manner, as to
which one may not unreasonably prefer a romantic explanation.
No white man lives on this continent who has not himself
or in his ancestry the will that makes desire overt and
dynamic, the solitary strength to push his dream across seas.
Islands had been peopled before by this kind of selection,
notably England; never a continent. A reckless, egoistic, experimental
spirit governs, betrays, and preserves us still.</p>

<p>The elemental hunger for food, warmth, and refuge gives
no direct motive to business. People may live and reproduce
without business. Civilization of a sort may exist without its
offices. The settler who disappears into the wilderness with a
wife, a gun, a few tools, and some pairs of domestic beasts,
may create him an idyllic habitation, amid orchards and fields,
self-contained in rude plenty; but he is lost to business until
he produces a money crop, that is, a surplus of the fruits of
husbandry to exchange for fancy hardware, tea, window glass,
muslin, china, and luxuries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span></p>

<p>The American wilderness swallowed up hundreds of thousands
of such hearth-bearers. Business was slow to touch
them. What they had to sell was bulky. The cost of transportation
was prohibitive. There were no highways, only
rivers, for traffic to go upon. Food was cheap, because the
earth in a simple way was bounteous; but the things for which
food could be exchanged were dear. This would naturally be
true in a new country, where craft industry must develop
slowly. It was true also for another reason, which was that
the Mother Country regarded the New World as a plantation
to be exploited for the benefit of its own trade and manufactures.</p>

<p>Great Britain’s claim to proprietary interest in America having
been established against European rivals by the end of the
17th century, her struggle with the colonists began. The English
wanted (1) raw materials upon which to bestow their high
craft labour, (2) an exclusive market for the output of their
mills and factories, and (3) a monopoly of the carrying trade.
The colonists wanted industrial freedom. As long as they
held themselves to chimney-corner industries, making nails,
shoes, hats, and coarse cloth for their own use, there was no
quarrel. But when labour even in a small way began to devote
itself exclusively to handicraft, so that domestic manufactures
were offered for sale in competition with imported English
goods, that was business—and the British Parliament
voted measures to crush it. The weaving of cloth for sale was
forbidden, lest the colonists become independent of English
fabrics. So was the making of beaver hats; the English were
hatters. It was forbidden to set up an iron rolling-mill in
America, because the English required pig iron and wished to
work it themselves. To all these acts of Parliament the colonists
opposed subterfuge until they were strong enough to
be defiant. That impatience of legal restraints which is one
of the most obstinate traits of American business was then a
patriotic virtue.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the New England trader had appeared—that
adorable, hymning, unconscious pirate who bought molasses
in the French West Indies, swapped it for rum at Salem, Mass.,
traded the rum for Negroes on the African coast, exchanged the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
Negroes for tobacco in Virginia, and sold the tobacco for
money in Europe, at a profit to be settled with God. This
trade brought a great deal of money to the colonies; and they
needed money almost more than anything else. Then the
British laid a ban on trade with the French West Indies, put
a tax upon coastwise traffic between the colonies; and decreed
that American tobacco should be exported nowhere but to
English ports, although—or because—tobacco prices were
higher everywhere else in Europe. The natural consequence
of this restrictive British legislation was to make American
business utterly lawless. As much as a third of it was notoriously
conducted in defiance of law. Smuggling both in domestic
and foreign trade became a folk custom. John Hancock,
the first signer of the Declaration of Independence, was
a celebrated smuggler.</p>

<p>During the War of Independence domestic craft industry
was stimulated by necessity. But the means were crude and
the products imperfect; and when, after peace, British merchants
with an accumulation of goods on their hands began to
offer them for sale in the United States at low prices, hoping
to recover their new-world trade in competitive terms, the
infant industries cried out for protection. They got it. One
of the first acts of the American Congress was to erect a tariff
against foreign-made goods in order that the country might
become self-sufficing in manufactures. This was the beginning
of our protectionist policy.</p>

<p>Fewer than four million unbusiness-like people coming into
free possession of that part of the North American continent
which is named America was a fabulous business event. We
cannot even now comprehend it. They had not the dimmest
notion of what it was they were possessed of, nor what it
meant economically. Geography ran out at the Mississippi.
The tide of Westward immigration was just beginning to break
over the crest of the Alleghany mountains.</p>

<p>Over-seas trade grew rapidly, as there was always a surplus
of food and raw materials to be exchanged abroad for things
which American industry was unable to provide. Foreign
commerce was an important source of group-wealth and public
interest was much concerned with it. Besides, it was easier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
to trade across seas than inland. Philadelphia until about
1835 was nearer London than Pittsburgh, not as the crow flies
but as freight moves. Domestic business, arising from the
internal exchange of goods, developed slowly, owing partly to
the wretched state of transportation and partly to the self-contained
nature of families and communities. The population
was more than nine-tenths rural; rural habits survived
even in the towns, where people kept cows and pigs, cured
their own meats, preserved their own fruits and vegetables,
and thought ready-made garments a shocking extravagance.
Business under these conditions performed a subservient function.
People’s relations with it were in large measure voluntary.
Its uses were more luxurious than vital. There was not
then, nor could any one at this time have imagined, that interdependence
of individuals, groups, communities, and geographical
sections which it is the blind aim of business increasingly
to promote, so that at length the case is reversed and people
are subservient to business.</p>

<p>In Southern New Jersey you may see a farm, now prosperously
devoted to berry and fruit crops, on which, still in
good repair, are the cedar rail fences built by a farmer whose
contacts with business were six or eight trips a year over a
sand road to Trenton with surplus food to exchange for some
new tools, tea, coffee, and store luxuries. That old sand road
has become a cement pavement—a motor highway. Each
morning a New York baking corporation’s motor stops at the
farm-house and the driver hands in some fresh loaves. Presently
a butcher’s motor stops with fresh meat, then another
one with dry groceries, and yet another from a New York department
store with parcels containing ready-made garments,
stockings and shoes.</p>

<p>Consider what these four motors symbolize.</p>

<p>First is an automobile industry and a system for producing,
refining and distributing oil which together are worth as much
as the whole estimated wealth of America three generations
ago.</p>

<p>Back of the bakery wagon what a vista! An incorporated
baking industry, mixing, kneading, roasting, and wrapping the
loaf in paraffine paper without touch of human hands, all by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
automatic machinery. Beyond the Mississippi, in a country
undiscovered until 1804, the wheat fields that are ploughed,
sown, reaped by power-driven machinery. In Minnesota a
milling industry in which the miller has become an impersonal
flour trust. A railroad system that transports first the grain
and then the flour over vast distances at rates so low that the
cost of two or three thousand miles of transportation in the
loaf of bread delivered to the New Jersey farm-house is inexpressible....
Back of the butcher’s motor is a meat-packing
industry concentrated at Chicago. It sends fresh meat a
thousand miles in iced cars and sells it to a New Jersey farmer
for a price at which he can better afford to buy it than to bother
about producing it for himself.... Back of the grocer’s
motor are the food products and canning industries. By means
of machinery they shred, peel, hull, macerate, roll, cook, cool,
and pack fruits, cereals, and vegetables in cartons and containers
which are made, labelled, and sealed by other automatic
machinery.... And back of the department store
motor are the garment-making, shoe-making, textile, and knitting
industries.</p>

<p>If one link in all this ramified scheme of business breaks
there is chaos. If the State of New Jersey were suddenly cut
off from the offices of business for six months, a third of her
population might perish; not that the State is unable potentially
to sustain her own, but that the people have formed
habits of dependence upon others, as others depend upon them,
for the vital products of specialized labour.</p>

<p>All this has happened in the life of one cedar rail fence.
You say that is only fifty or sixty years. Nevertheless it is literally
so. The system under which we live has been evolved
since 1860. The transformation was sudden. Never in the
world were the physical conditions of a nation’s life altered
so fast by economic means. Yet it did not happen for many
years. The work of unconscious preparation occupied three-quarters
of a century.</p>

<p>Man acts upon his environment with hands, tools, and imagination;
and business requires above everything else the means
of cheap and rapid transportation. In all the major particulars
save one the founders were ill-equipped for their independent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
attack upon the American environment. At the beginning
of the 19th century there were no roads, merely a few
trails fit only for horseback travel. There were no canals yet.
And the labour wherewith to perform heavy, monotonous tasks
was dear and scarce and largely self-employed. Though the
hands of the pioneer are restless they are not patiently industrious.
There was need of machinery such as had already
begun to revolutionize British industry, but the English jealously
protected their mechanical knowledge.</p>

<p>There is a tradition that the Americans were marvellously
inventive with labour-saving devices. That is to be qualified.
Their special genius lay rather in the adaptation and enthusiastic
use of such devices. The introduction of them was not
resisted as in the older countries by labour unwilling to change
its habits and fearful of unemployment. This was an important
advantage.</p>

<p>The American textile industry was founded by British artisans
who came to this country carrying contraband in their
heads, that is, the plans of weaving, spinning, and knitting
machines which the English guarded as carefully as military
secrets.... The pre-eminence of this country in the manufacture
and use of agricultural implements is set out in elementary
school-books as proof of American inventiveness; yet the
essential principles of the reaper were evolved in Great Britain
forty years before the appearance of the historic McCormick
reaper (1831) in this country, and threshing-machines were in
general use in England while primitive methods of flailing,
trampling, and dragging prevailed in America. As recently as
1850 the scythe and cradle reaped the American harvest and
there still existed the superstition that an iron plough poisoned
the soil and stimulated weeds. Of all the tools invented
or adopted the one which Americans were to make the most
prodigious use of was the railroad; yet the first locomotive was
brought from England in 1829, the embargo on machinery having
by this time been lifted—and it failed because it was too
heavy!</p>

<p>Twenty years passed and still the possibilities of rail transportation
were unperceived, which is perhaps somewhat explained
by the fact that the one largest vested interest of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
time existed in canals. On the map of 1850 the railroads resemble
earthworms afraid to leave water and go inland. The
notion of a railroad was that it supplemented water transportation,
connecting lake, canal, and river routes, helping traffic
over the high places.</p>

<p>But in the next ten years—1850 to 1860—destiny surrendered.
There was that rare coincidence of seed, weather, deep
ploughing, and mysterious sanction which the miracle requires.
The essential power of the American was suddenly liberated.
There was the discovery of gold in California. There was the
Crimean War, which created a high demand abroad for our
commodities. The telegraph put its indignities upon time and
space. The idea of a railroad as a tool of empire seized the
imagination. Railroads were deliriously constructed. The
map of 1860 shows a glistening steel web from the seaboard to
the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The gigantesque was enthroned as the national fetich. Votive
offerings were mass, velocity, quantity. True cities began.
The spirit of Chicago was born. Bigness and be-damnedness.
In this decade the outlines of our economic development were
cast for good.</p>

<p>In the exclusive perspective of business the Civil War is an
indistinct episode. It stimulated industry in the North, shattered
it in the South. The net result in a purely economic
sense is a matter of free opinion. The Morse telegraph code
probably created more wealth than the war directly destroyed.
Or the bitter sectional row over the route of the first transcontinental
railroad which postponed that project for ten years
possibly cost the country more than the struggle to preserve
the Union. But that is all forgotten.</p>

<p>After 1860 the momentum of growth, notwithstanding the
war and two terrible panics, was cumulative. In the next fifty
years, down to 1910, we built half as much railroad mileage
as all the rest of the world. Population trebled. This fact
stands alone in the data of vital statistics. Yet even more remarkable
were the alterations of human activity. The number
of city dwellers increased 3½ times faster than the population;
the number of wage-earners, 2 times faster; clerks, salesmen,
and typists, 6½ times faster; banks, 7 times faster;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
corporations, 6½ times faster; miners, 3 times faster; transportation-workers,
20 times faster, and the number of independent
farmers decreased. Wealth in this time increased
from about $500 to more than $1,500 <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">per capita</i>.</p>

<p>If America in its present state of being had been revealed
to the imagination of any hard-headed economist in, say, 1850,
as a mirage or dream, he would have said: “There is in all
the world not enough labour and capital to do it.” He could
not have guessed how the power of both would be multiplied.</p>

<p>First there was the enormous simple addition to the labour
supply in the form of immigration. Then the evolution of
machinery and time-saving methods incredibly increased the
productivity of labour per human unit. Thirdly, the application
of power to agriculture and the opening of all that virgin
country west of the Mississippi to bonanza-farming so greatly
increased the production of food per unit of rural labour that
at length it required only half the population to feed the whole.
The other half was free. Business and industry absorbed
it.</p>

<p>Of what happened at the same time to capital, in which term
we include also credit, there could have been no prescience
at all. Even now when we think of building a railroad, a telephone
system, or an automobile factory the thought is that
it will take capital, as of course it will at first, but one should
consider also how anything that increases the velocity with
which goods are exchanged, or reduces the time in which a
given amount of business may be transacted, adds to the functioning
power of capital. To illustrate this: the merchant of
1850 did business very largely with his own capital unaided.
He was obliged to invest heavily in merchandise stocks. The
turn-over was slow. His margin of profit necessarily had to
be large. But with the development of transportation and
means of communication—the railroad, telegraph, and telephone—and
with the parallel growth of banking facilities, the
conditions of doing business were fundamentally changed. All
the time-factors were foreshortened.</p>

<p>A merchant now has to lock up much less capital in merchandise,
since his stocks are easily and swiftly replenished.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
The turn-over is much faster because people using suburban
railways and street-cars go oftener to shop. And not only is
it possible for these reasons to do a larger volume of business
with a given amount of capital, but the merchant now borrows
two-thirds, maybe three-quarters, of his capital at the bank
in the form of credit. The same is true of the manufacturer.
Formerly he locked up his capital, first in raw materials and
then in finished products to be sold in season as the demand
was; and there was great risk of loss in this way of matching
supply to an estimated demand. Now he sells his goods before
he makes them, borrows credit at the bank to buy his raw
materials, even to pay his labour through the processes of
manufacture, and when the customer pays on delivery of the
goods with credit which he also has borrowed at the bank, the
manufacturer settles with <em>his</em> bank and keeps the difference.
An exporter was formerly one who bought commodities with
his own money, loaded them on ship, sent them on chance to
a foreign market, and waited for his capital to come back
with a profit. Now he first sells the goods to a foreign customer
by cable, then buys them on credit, loads them on ship,
sells the bill of lading to a bank, uses the proceeds to pay for
the goods, and counts his profit. All large business now is
transacted in this way with phantom capital, called credit;
money is employed to settle differences only.</p>

<p>The effect of this revolution of methods upon the morals
and manners of business was tremendous. It destroyed the
aristocracy of business by throwing the field open to men
without capital. Traders and brokers over-ran it. The man
doing business on borrowed capital could out-trade one doing
business on his own. The more he borrowed, the harder he
could trade. Salesmanship became a specialized, conscienceless
art. There was no rule but to take all the traffic would
bear: let the buyer look out. Dishonesty in business became
so gross that it had to be sublimated in the national sense of
humour. There are many still living who remember what
shopping was like even in the largest city stores when nobody
dreamed of paying the price first asked and counter-higgling
was a universal custom. Indeed, so ingrained it was that when
A. T. Stewart in New York announced the experiment of treating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
all buyers alike on a one-price basis his ruin was predicted
by the whole merchant community.</p>

<p>As credit both increases competition and enables a larger
business to be done on a small base of invested capital, the
margin of profit in business tends to fall. Under conditions
of intense rivalry among merchants and manufacturers operating
more and more with phantom capital the margin of
profit did fall until it was very thin indeed. This led to the
abasement of goods by adulteration and tricks of manufacture,
which became at length so great an evil that the government
had to interfere with pure-food acts and laws forbidding
wilful misrepresentation.</p>

<p>There was a limit beyond which the cost of production could
not be reduced by degradation of quality. It was impossible
to control prices with competition so wild and spontaneous and
with cheapness the touchword of success. Therefore the wages
of business were low, and things apparently had come to an
impasse. Yet out of this chaos arose what now we know as
big business. The idea was simple—mass production of
standardized foods. The small, fierce units of business began
to be amalgamated. As society is integrated by steps—clan,
tribe, nation, State—so big business passed through mergers,
combines, and trusts toward the goal of monopoly.</p>

<p>When a number of competing manufacturers unite to produce
standard commodities in quantity, much duplication of
effort is eliminated, time-saving methods are possible as not
before, the cost of production is reduced. There are other
advantages. They are stronger than they were separately, not
only as buyers of labour, raw materials, and transportation,
but as borrowers of capital. The individual or firm is the
customer of a bank. The corporation makes a partnership
with finance.</p>

<p>Now a curious thing happens. The corporation with its
mass production restores the quality of goods. It is responsible
for its products and guarantees them by brands, labels and
trade-marks. Sugar and oatmeal come out of the anonymous
barrel behind the grocer’s counter and go into attractive cartons
on his shelf, bearing the name of the producer. Gloves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
shirts, stockings, cutlery, furniture, meat products, jams,
watches, fabrics, everything in fact becomes standardized by
name and price and is advertised by the producer directly to
the public over the retailer’s head, so that the small retailer is
no longer a merchant in the old sense but a grumbling commission-man.
Big business has delivered itself from the impasse;
it has recovered control of its profits; but now the retailer’s
margin of profit tends to become fixed. What does the
retailer do? He applies the same principle to the last act of
selling. Enter the chain-store. Obviously a corporation owning
a chain of several hundred stores and working, like the
manufacturer, with borrowed capital, is stronger than any one
retailer to bargain with the powerful producers, and as the
chain-store tends to displace the little retailer a balance is
restored between the business of production and the business
of retailing. Mass production is met by mass selling. The
consumer as the last subject may resort to legislation for his
protection.</p>

<p>Big business could not have evolved in this way without
the aid of the railroads. Their dilemma was similar. Strife
and competition had ruined their profits. To begin with, nobody
knew what it cost to produce transportation. When a
new line was opened it made rates according to circumstances.
At points where it met water competition it charged very little,
sometimes less than the cost of its fuel, and at points where
there was no competition it charged all the traffic would stand.
Then as competitive railroad-building excessively increased the
high rates steadily fell. Once they got started people were
obsessed to make railroads. They made them for speculative
reasons, for feudal reasons, for political reasons, for any reason
at all. Two men might quarrel in Wall Street, and one would
build a thousand miles of railroad to spite the other—build it
with the proceeds of shares sold to the public or hypothecated
at the bank. Then there would be two roads to divide the
business of one. Railroads under these conditions were unscientifically
planned and over-built. The profit was rather
in the building than in the working of them. There was scandal
both ways. Quantities of fictitious capital were created<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
and sold to the public. And when a railroad was built it became
the plaything of its traffic manager, who conspired with
other traffic managers to sell favours to shippers and to invent
disastrous rate-wars in order to profit by the fall of shares
on the stock market.</p>

<p>Rates could not be raised or held up, owing to the irresponsible
nature of the competition. Transportation is a commodity
that cannot be adulterated. How was the profit to be
restored in this field of business? Why, by the same method
as in industry. That is, by mass production.</p>

<p>Some one discovered that once you got a loaded train out
of the terminal and rolling on the right-of-way it cost almost
nothing to keep it moving. There was no money in hauling
small lots of freight short distances at the highest rates that
could be charged; but there was profit in moving large quantities
of freight in full cars over long distances at very low
rates. At this the railroad people went mad over the long,
heavy haul. Here was industry seeking to concentrate itself
in fewer places for purposes of mass production; and here were
the railroads wanting masses of freight to move long distances.
Their problems coincided.</p>

<p>Result: mass production gravitates to those far-apart long-haul
points to get the benefit of low rates, there is congestion
of industrial population at those points, industry at intermediate
points is penalized by higher freight rates, and the
railroads henceforth equip themselves with mass tonnage primarily
in view. You begin now to have steel towns, meat
towns, flour towns, textile towns, garment towns, and so on.
That interdependence of communities and geographical sections
which makes business is in full development.</p>

<p>However, the second state of the railroad is worse than the
first. It is overwhelmed by the monster it has suckled. It is
at the mercy of a few big shippers, masters of mass production,
who bully it, extort lower and lower rates still, and at
length secret rebates, under threat of transferring their tonnage
to another railroad or in some cases of building their own
railroad, which now they are powerful enough to do. The railroad
yields; and whereas before only such industry as survived
at intermediate points was penalized by higher freight rates,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
now all industry outside of big business is at a disadvantage,
since big business is receiving secret benefits from the railroads.</p>

<p>There was no philosophy in any of this, not even a high
order of intelligence. The will of business is anarchistic; its
religion is fatalism. If let alone, it will seek its profit by any
means that serve and then view the consequences as acts of
Providence.</p>

<p>It has been noted that big business, going in for mass production,
restored the honesty of goods. The motive was not
ethical. It paid. The public’s good will toward a brand or a
trade-mark was an asset that could be capitalized, sometimes
for more than plant and equipment, and the shares
representing such capitalization could be sold to the public on
the Stock Exchange. But what was gained for morality in the
honesty of goods was lost again in new forms of dishonesty.
Standard Oil products were always cheap and honest; its oil
was never watered. But the means by which the Standard Oil
Company gained its dangerous trade eminence were dishonest,
and the trust was dissolved for that reason by the United States
Supreme Court. It happens to be only the most notable instance.
There were and are still many others—combines and
trusts whose products are honest but whose tradeways are
either illegal or ethically repugnant.</p>

<p>One cannot say that business is either honest or dishonest.
It is both. Evidence of permanent gain in a kind of intrinsic
commercial honesty is abundant. Wild-cat banking has disappeared.
A simple book entry between merchants is as good
as a promissory note. The integrity of merchandise now is a
trade custom. Vulgar misrepresentations have ceased save in
the slums of business. The practice of making open prices
to all buyers alike, wholesale and retail, is universal. It is
no longer possible to print railroad shares surreptitiously overnight
and flood the Stock Exchange with them the next morning,
as once happened in Erie. Nowhere is character more
esteemed than in business.</p>

<p>And yet, in spite of all this and parallel with it, runs a bitter
feud between society and business. People are continually
acting upon big business through the agencies of government
to make it behave. What is the explanation?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span></p>

<p>Well, in the first place, the improvement in commercial honesty
has been owing not so much to ethical enlightenment as
to internal necessity. Big business must do its work on credit;
there is no other way. Therefore credit is a sacred thing, to
be preserved by all means. Men know that unless they are
scrupulous in fulfilling their obligations toward it, the system
will collapse. As the use of credit increases the code of business
become more rigid. It must. One who breaks faith with
the code is not merely dishonest, man to man; he is an enemy
of credit.</p>

<p>If a stock-market coterie of this day could print Erie shares
without notice and sell them the public would suffer of course
but Wall Street would suffer much more. Its own affairs
would fall into hopeless disorder. That kind of thing cannot
happen again. The code has been improved. You now may
be sure that anything you buy on the Stock Exchange has been
regularly issued and listed. No institution is more jealous of
the integrity of its transactions—transactions as such. Purchases
and sales involving millions are consummated with a nod
of the head and simple dishonesty is unknown. Nevertheless,
it is a notorious fact that the amount of money nowadays lost
on the Stock Exchange by the unwary public is vastly greater
than in Jay Gould’s time. There is, you see, an important difference
between formal and moral honesty.</p>

<p>Secondly, business morality is a term without meaning.
There is no such thing. Business is neither moral nor immoral.
It represents man’s acquisitive instinct acting outside
of humanistic motives. Morals are personal and social. Business
is impersonal and unsocial.</p>

<p>So far we come clear. Only now, what shall be said of the
man in business? He is not a race apart. He may be any of
us. How then shall we account for the fact that those evils
and tyrannies of big business with which the Congress, the
Interstate Commerce Commission, the Department of Justice,
the Federal Trade Board, and other agencies of the social will
keep open war are not inhibited at the head by an innate social
sense? Does the business man lose that sense? Or by
reason of the material in which he works does he become an
unsocial being? No. The answer is that the kind of business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
we now are talking about is not conducted by men. It is
conducted by corporations.</p>

<p>A thing of policy purely, with only legal responsibilities and
no personality, free from hope of heaven or fear of hell, the
corporation is both a perfect instrument for the impersonal
ends of business and a cave of refuge for the conscience. Business
by corporations is highly responsible in all that pertains
to business. Business by corporations is in all ethical respects
anonymous. A corporation does many things which no one of
its directors would do as an individual. The head of a corporation
says: “If it were my own business, I should handle this
labour problem very differently. But it isn’t. I am a trustee,
answerable to five thousand stockholders for the security of
their dividends.” Each of the five thousand stockholders says:
“It isn’t my business. I am merely one of a great number of
stockholders. What can I do about it?”</p>

<p>Nobody is personally responsible.</p>

<p>More than two-thirds of our national wealth is owned by
corporations. They control at some point every process of economic
life. Their power is so great that many have wondered
whether in time it might not overwhelm popular government.
Yet in all this realm of power there is nowhere that sense of
personal moral liability which is acknowledged between men
and without which civilized human relationships would become
utterly impossible. A corporation is like a State in this respect:
it cannot, if it would, make moral decisions. The right to do
that is not delegated by people to a State nor by stockholders
to a corporation. Both therefore are limited to material decisions.</p>

<p>It is probably owing as much to the power-thirsty, law-baiting
temperament of the American in business as to the
magnitude of the work to be done that the use of the corporation,
like the use of labour-saving machinery, has been carried
further here than in any other country. Railroads naturally
were the first great corporations. The amount of capital required
to build a railroad is beyond the resources of any small
group of individuals; it must be gathered from a large number,
who become shareholders. The original railroads were subsidized
by the government with loans of money and enormous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
grants of land. Industrial and trading corporations came
later. For a long time America was to all corporations a Garden
of Eden. They were encouraged, not precisely that they
were presumed to be innocent but because they were indispensable.
Then they ate of the Tree of Political Power and
the feud was on. When people began really to fear them
their roots were already very deep and touched nearly everything
that was solid. The sinister alliance between big business
and high finance was accomplished.</p>

<p>One of the absurdities of the case was and is that any State
according to its own laws may grant corporation-charters
which carry rights of eminent domain in all other states. The
Standard Oil Company was once dissolved in Ohio. It took
out a new charter in New Jersey, and went on as before, even
in Ohio.</p>

<p>Every attempt to reform their oppressive ways by law they
have resisted under the constitution as an attack upon the
rights of property. And there has always been much confusion
as to what the law was. In one case it was construed by
the United States Supreme Court to mean that bigness itself,
the mere power of evil, was illegal whether it had been exercised
or not; in another, that each instance must be treated
on its merits by a rule of reason, and, in still another, that the
potential power to restrain trade in a monopolistic manner
was not in itself illegal provided it had never been used.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the doubt as to which should control the other—the
State the corporations or the corporations the State—has
been resolved. Gradually the authority of the State has
been asserted. The hand of the corporation in national politics
is branded. The Federal Government’s control over the
rates and practices of the railroads is complete; so likewise is
the control of many of the several separate States over the
rates and practices of public-utility corporations. Federal
authority over the tradeways of the great industrial and trading
corporations whose operations are either so large or so essential,
to economic life as to become clothed with public interest
is far advanced; and supervision of profits is beginning.</p>

<p>Now what manner of profit and loss account may we write
with American business?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span></p>

<p>Given to begin with an environment superb, it has made
wealth available to an aggregate extent hitherto unimaginable
in the world. But in doing this it has created a conscious, implacable
proletariat in revolt against private profit.</p>

<p>In production it has brought about a marvellous economy of
human effort. At the same time it has created colossal forms
of social waste. It wastes the spirit by depriving the individual
of that sense of personal achievement, that feeling of
participation in the final result, which is the whole joy of
craftsmanship, so that the mind is bored and the heart is
seared. It wastes all things prodigally in the effort to create
new and extravagant wants, reserving its most dazzling rewards
for him that can make two glittering baubles to sell
where only one was sold before. It wastes the living machine
in recurring periods of frightful and unnecessary idleness.</p>

<p>For the distribution of goods it has perfected a web of exchange,
so elaborate that the breaking of one strand is a disaster
and yet so trustworthy that we take its conveniences
every day for granted and never worry. But the adjustment
of supply to demand is so rude and uncontrolled that we
suffer periodic economic calamities, extreme trade depression,
and social distress, because there has been an over-production
of some things at a price-impasse between producer and consumer.</p>

<p>In the field of finance and credit it has evolved a mechanism
of the highest dynamic intensity known; yet the speculative
abuse of credit is an unmitigated scandal, and nothing whatever
has been done to eliminate or diminish those alternations
of high and low prices, inflation and deflation, which produce
panics and perilous political disorder. On the contrary, business
continues fast in the antique superstition that such things
happen in obedience to inexorable laws.</p>

<p>In the Great War American business amazed the world, itself
included. In 1914 the United States was a debtor nation,
owing Europe 3 billions of dollars. By the end of 1920 we
were the largest creditor nation on earth, other nations owing
us 15 billions. This means simply that in six years this country
produced in excess of its own needs and sent abroad commodities
amounting to 18 billions of dollars. In 1921, to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
naïve astonishment of business, the foreign demand for American
goods slumped because foreign countries had not the
means to go on buying at any such rate. The result was an
acute panic in prices here, trade prostration, unemployment,
and sounds of despair. The case was stated by leaders of
business and finance in these ominous terms: “America is
over-equipped. It has the capacity to produce more of everything
than it needs. Therefore unless we continuously sell our
surplus abroad, unless the American government will lend foreign
countries the credit with which to buy our excess production,
prosperity is shattered. Factories will shut up, fields will
lie fallow, labour will suffer for want of work. Moreover, we
are threatened with a deluge of foreign goods, for presently
the countries that owe us 18 billions of dollars will be trying
to pay us with commodities. If we open our markets to their
goods our own industries will be ruined. So we must have
high tariffs to protect American producers from the competition
of foreign merchandise.”</p>

<p>Ruined by over-plenty!</p>

<p>We are equipped to produce more of the goods that satisfy
human wants than we can use, our command over the labour
of foreign countries by reason of the debt they owe us is enormous,
and <em>business desponds</em>.</p>

<p>Attend. To keep our prosperity we must sell away our
surplus, or if necessary give it away to foreign countries on
credit, and then protect ourselves against their efforts to repay
us! The simple absurdity of this proposition is self-evident.
We mention it only for what it signifies. And it signifies that
business is a blind, momentous sequence, with extravagant reflex
powers of accommodation and extension and almost no faculty
of original imagination.</p>

<p>American business despairing at over-production and the
American Indian shivering on top of the Pennsylvania coalfields—these
are twin ironies.</p>

<p>John Law’s Mississippi Bubble dream three centuries ago
was a phantasy of escape from the boredom of toil. The
bubble itself has been captured. That is the story of American
business. But who has escaped, save always a few at the
expense of many? There may be in fact no other way. Still,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
the phantasy will not lie. And nobody knows for sure what
will happen when business is no longer a feudal-minded thing,
with rights and institutions apart, seeking its own profit as the
consummate end, and perceives itself in the light of a subordinate
human function, justified by service.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ENGINEERING">ENGINEERING</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">American</span> engineering made its beginning almost immediately
after the end of the War for Independence.
The pursuits of the colonists under British domination
were mainly agricultural. Manufacturing was systematically
thwarted in order that the Colonies might become a market
for the finished goods of England. Objection to this form of
sabotage subsequently developed into one of the main causes
of the Revolutionary War. It was but natural, therefore, as
soon as the artificial restrictions imposed upon Colonial enterprise
were removed, for the new citizens of America to
devise machinery, build roads and canals, and plan cities.</p>

<p>The early engineers who carried on this work were seldom
formally trained. They were little more than higher types of
artisans. It was only after thirty-odd years of discussion and
agitation that the first scientific schools were established in
this country—two in number. And it was only after the enactment
of the Morrill Act by Congress (1862) that formal
engineering training as we know it to-day was put on a firm
national basis. By 1870, 866 engineers had been graduated
from American technical schools and colleges. The real advent
of the typical American engineer, however, has only occurred
since 1870. At present he is being supplied to the industries
of the country at the rate of 5,000 a year.</p>

<p>The coming of the formally trained technologist or scientist
of industry lagged somewhat behind the development of the
industrial revolution. This was particularly true in America.
Originally all attention was centered on the training of
so-called civil engineers, i.e., canal, bridge, road, dam and
building designers and constructors. The rapid rise of the mechanical
arts after the Civil War focused attention on the
training of engineers expert in manufacturing. To-day the
mechanical and electrical engineers are more numerous than
any other group and have far outstripped the civil engineers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span></p>

<p>The original function of the engineer, especially in the first
days of his systematic training, was to deal scientifically with
purely mechanical problems. Thus the oft quoted definition
of the British Institution of Civil Engineers that “Engineering
is the art of directing the great sources of power in nature
for the use and convenience of man” reveals quite clearly
the legitimate field within which the engineer was supposed to
operate. He was to harness the untamed energies of nature.
That this conception was then sufficient, and that the careers
of most engineers were shaped accordingly, is hardly to be disputed.
Nor, judging from the achievement of American engineers
in the last fifty years, can it be contended that their
function was conceived in too narrow a light. Undoubtedly,
the problems of mechanical production, power-creation and
transmission, bridge and building construction, and railway
and marine transportation, during this period were largely material
ones, and the opportunities for their solution were especially
good. To these the engineers directed their attention.
Thanks to their training, technique, and accumulated experience,
they became more and more successful in solving them.
At the same time, their relative freedom of thought and action
with reference to technological problems brought them into
more or less coherent groups which, as time went on, began to
conceive a larger function for the engineer—service to society
as a whole rather than the solving of mere concrete, specific
difficulties.</p>

<p>For while the material problems of production are undoubtedly
as important as ever, the present-day industrial system
has begun to reveal new problems which the engineer in America
has, to a limited extent, come to realize must be faced.
These new problems are not material in the old sense of the
word; they concern themselves with the control and administration
of the units of our producing system. Their nature is
psychological and economic.</p>

<p>Certain groups in the American engineering profession have
become quite conscious that these deeper problems are not being
solved; at the same time they consider it a necessary duty
to help in their solution, inasmuch as the engineer, they feel,
is peculiarly fitted to see his way clearly through them. Thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
is being split off from the main body of old-line engineers, a
new wing not so much concerned with wringing power from
nature as with adjusting power to legitimate social needs. As
against the old engineer, concerned primarily with design and
construction, there is to be recognized the new engineer, concerned
mainly with industrial management.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, a strict evaluation of the engineer’s
status with reference to the influence he may have on the solution
of these social and economic problems causes serious
doubts to arise regarding his ultimate possibilities in this field.
Despite his great value and recognized indispensability as a
technologist, expert in problems of materials and processes of
manufacture, he can at best but serve in an advisory capacity
on questions affecting the division of the national surplus or
the control of industry. Nevertheless, it is of fundamental
significance that the American engineering profession has of
late considerably widened the scope of the British Institution
of Civil Engineers’ definition of engineering, namely, to the
effect that “Engineering is the science of controlling the forces
and utilizing the materials of nature for the benefit of man <em>and
the art of organizing and of directing human activities in connection
therewith</em>.” The implications of this much broader
definition, if widely accepted, will bring the American engineers
sooner or later squarely before a fundamental issue.</p>

<p>The ideal of service is profoundly inherent in the profession
of engineering. But so, also, is the ideal of creative work.
The achievements of engineering enterprise are easily visualized
and understood, and from them the engineer is wont to derive
a great deal of satisfaction. Recently, however, the exactions
of the modern complex economic system, in which the engineer
finds himself relatively unimportant compared with, say, the
financier, have contrived to rob him of this satisfaction. And
as his creative instincts have been thwarted, he has turned
upon business enterprise itself a sharp and inquiring eye.
From isolated criticisms of wastes and inefficiencies in industry,
for instance, he has not found it a long or difficult step to
the investigation of industry on a national basis for the purpose
of exposing technical and managerial shortcomings.</p>

<p>It appears, however, that the majority of American engineers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
to-day believe that their position as a class is such that
they can effectively maintain an impartial position when differences
which arise between large economic groups of society
such as those of the merchant, the manufacturer, the labourer,
the farmer, although these differences frequently lead to economic
waste and loss. At all events, it is on this basis that
attempts are being made to formulate a general policy for
engineers as a class to pursue. It is very doubtful, however,
whether a group such as the engineers, constituting the “indispensable
general staff of industry,” can long take an impartial
attitude towards two such conflicting forces as capital and
labour so long as they (the engineers) adhere to the ideal of
maximum service and efficiency. The pickets of the fence
may eventually prove unduly sharp.</p>

<p>A minority group which believes otherwise has already organized
into an international federation of technicians affiliated
with the standard organized labour movement of America.
This group holds that the engineer is a wage-earner like all
other industrial workers, and that his economic welfare in many
instances is no better than that of ordinary wage-earners.
In addition, this group maintains that in the last analysis it is
flatly impossible for engineers to take an impartial attitude in
the struggle between capital and labour. Hence they advocate
the engineer affiliating with the organized labour movement
like other wage earners and, in times of crisis, throwing his influence
with the workers of industry.</p>

<p>The organized labour movement of America has indicated
in clear terms its estimate of the American engineer’s true
value and opportunity. The American Federation of Labour
in 1919 issued the following statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To promote further the production of an adequate supply of the
world’s needs for use and higher standards of life, we urge that there
be established co-operation between the scientist of industry and the
representatives of the organized workers.”</p>
</div>

<p>This conviction has also been expressed in the following
terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The trades-union movement of America understands fully the
necessity for adequate production of the necessities of life. American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
labour understands, perhaps more fully than do American statesmen,
the needs of the world in this hour, and it is exerting every
effort to see that those needs are met with intelligence and with
promptness. The question of increased productivity is not a question
of putting upon the toilers a more severe strain; it is a question
of vast fundamental changes in the management of industry; a question
of the elimination of outworn policies; a question of the introduction
of the very best in machinery and methods of management.”</p>
</div>

<p>The fundamental significance of these attitudes of the engineers
and the organized workers of the country will perhaps
be better understood when it is realized how indispensable the
engineers have become in the conduct of industrial affairs
to-day. While virtually the product of the last fifty years,
they have already fallen heir to one of the most strategic positions
in society. To them are entrusted the real “trade secrets”
of industry. Only they understand how far the intricate
material processes of manufacture are interdependent, and how
they can be kept in harmony. The engineers have the skill
and the understanding which is absolutely necessary for industrial
management. Without their guidance the present highly
complicated system of production would quickly tumble into
chaos.</p>

<p>The ownership of industry has frequently been suggested
as the key to the true emancipation of the great mass of workers
of a nation. Leastwise many theoretical arguments on
the process of workers’ liberation have been premised on the
necessity of eventually liquidating the institution of private
property. How futile such a programme is without recognizing
the indispensable part which technical and managerial
skill plays in any system of production has been emphasized
again and again by individuals, notably in Russia and Italy,
where the experiment of securing production without the
assistance of adequate technical control has been tried. In
fact, the whole question of property control is secondary when
once the true value of engineering management is understood.
In so far as the American workers see this, and make it possible
for American engineers to co-operate with them in their
struggle for liberation, will they make the task of the worker
more easy and avoid the frequent recurrence of wasteful and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
often tragic conflict. The burden, however, is equally upon
the shoulders of the engineer to meet labour half way in this
enterprise.</p>

<p>It is very much to be doubted if most American engineers
really have a clear understanding of the position in which
they find themselves, beyond a general conception of their
apparent impartiality. The progressive economic concepts
and activities which have been outlined, while advanced by
representatives of national associations of engineers, are not
necessarily the reflection of the great mass of American engineers
to-day, over 200,000 strong. Nevertheless, it is fortunate
that an otherwise conservative and socially timid body
of individuals, such as the engineers frequently have been in
the past, should now find itself represented by a few spokesmen
at least who are able to promulgate clear statements on
fundamental issues. The rank and file of engineers have a
long road to travel before they will be in a position to command
adequate consideration for their basic ideals and purposes
as expressed in their new definition of engineering, and
as proposed by some of their leaders.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, seriously to be doubted if many engineers
of America have really had the training to grasp the relation
of their position to the economic developments of to-day.
Conventional engineering education has been entirely too narrow
in its purpose. It has succeeded in turning out good
technical practitioners, not far-seeing economic statesmen. In
recent years many engineering schools have placed emphasis
on what has aptly been termed “The business features of engineering
practice.” This, while conceivably a good thing from
the standpoint of the limits within which engineering enterprise
must ordinarily function to-day, is bound to over-emphasize
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">status quo</i>, and so confine the vision of the engineer.</p>

<p>Engineers in this country have frequently taken a sort of
pharisaic attitude on the desirability—offhand—of delegating
the entire running of things human to technical experts. While
such experts may usually have been quite successful in operating
engineering enterprises, it hardly follows that this necessarily
qualifies them for the wholesale conduct of the affairs of
society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span></p>

<p>Yet the demand on the part of certain engineers for a more
fundamental participation in the conduct of the larger economic
and political affairs of society should be construed as
a healthy sign. It is an outgrowth of an intellectual unrest
among the profession, precipitated by the thwarting of a genuine
desire to build and serve. This unrest, in the absence of
a constructive outlet combined with the past failure of engineering
education to provide a real intellectual background,
has resulted from time to time in some amusing phenomena.
Thus not a few engineers have developed a sort of symbolism
or mysticism, expressed in the terminology of their profession,
with a view to building a new heaven and a new earth whose
directing head they propose to be. From this they derive a
peculiar satisfaction and perhaps temporary inspiration, and
incidentally they often seem to confound laymen who do not
understand the meaning of their terms. Instead of deriving
comfort from symbolic speculations and futurist engineering
diagrams, one would rather expect engineers to be realists,
especially in the larger affairs of their profession. The seriousness
with which the speculations concerning “space-binding”
and “time-binding” have been taken is an example of how
engineers with their present one-sided intellectual development
may seize upon metaphysical cobwebs for spiritual solace in
their predicament.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the intellectual limitations of many American
engineers is revealed by some of the controversies which
engage the technical societies and the technical periodicals.
A notable and recurring instance is the debate concerning the
relative merits of steam and electrical operation of railways.
The real question which underlies replacing a going system
with one which is better but more costly in capital outlay is
primarily economic in nature. Consequently such a change is
contingent upon a revised distribution of the national surplus
rather than on the comparative merits of detail parts. This
fact seldom seems to get home to the engineers. They have
been arguing for the last fifteen years the relative advantages
of this or that detail, failing all the while to understand that
the best, in the large, from an engineering standpoint, can
be secured only when unrestricted, free enterprise has given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
way to some form of enterprise regulated principally in the
interest of public service.</p>

<p>The profession of engineering, especially in America, is still
young enough not to have become ridden with tradition and
convention. It has developed rapidly along essentially pragmatic
though perhaps narrow lines. Certainly it is not bound
and circumscribed by precedent and convention like the legal
profession, or even the medical profession. Above all, it derives
its inspiration from powerful physical realities, and this
constitutes its bulwark.</p>

<p>What the profession really lacks are two fundamentals, absolutely
necessary for any group strategically located and
desirous of leadership in society. These are: (1) an intellectual
background based squarely upon a comprehensive study
of the economic and political institutions of society, their history,
growth, and function, together with a study of the larger
aspects of human behaviour and rights; and, (2) the development
of a facility for intelligent criticism, especially of engineering
and economic enterprises. A wholesome intellectual
background is necessary to interpret the new position and its
prerogatives which the application of science has created for
the engineer. A development of the critical faculty is desirable
in order to enable him to detect the blandishments of
cult, the temptations of formulas and systems expressed in
indefinable abstractions, and the pitfalls of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">status quo</i>.</p>

<p>The responsibility for the American engineer’s function in
society rests largely upon the schools which train him. Engineering
education in America has done its task relatively well
considered from the simple technical point of view. Of late,
progressive engineering educators have stressed the necessity
for paying more attention to the humanistic studies in the engineering
curriculum. The beginning made in this respect is,
however, entirely too meagre to warrant much hope that
younger American engineers will soon acquire either that intellectual
background or genuine critical faculty which will
entitle them to a larger share of responsibility for the affairs
of men.</p>

<p>The most hopeful sign in this direction is rather the fusion
of the engineers into a large federation of societies, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
service to the community, State, and Nation as their motto;
a growing tendency, collectively, at least, to investigate the
conduct of national industrial enterprises; and, finally, an attempt
at a rapprochement, in the interest of society, between
labour and the engineers. Ere long these developments will
reflect themselves in the schools of engineering, and then, it is
reasonable to expect, will the process of developing a truly
worthy class of industrial leaders in this country really make
its beginning. In America to-day no such leadership exists.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="NERVES">NERVES</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Young</span> as America is, she is nevertheless old enough to
have known the time when there were no such things
as nerves. Our earliest settlers and colonists, our proverbially
hardy pioneers apparently managed to get along with a very
modest repertory of diseases. They died, if not from malnutrition
or exposure or from Indians, then from some old-fashioned,
heaven-sent seizure or sudden pain, not to mention
from “old age,” long a favourite diagnosis of a pious and
not too inquisitive school of medicine even where the patient’s
age had to be entered by the coroner as of forty or thereabouts.
As for the various forms of nervousness which belong
to our age of indulgence and luxury, they were unknown to
those sturdier times, and would undoubtedly have put their
unhappy victims under the quick suspicion of having had forbidden
converse with the Devil.</p>

<p>If, nevertheless, we feel justified in assuming that this
golden age of health and disease probably hid beneath its tinsel
a good many of the nervous afflictions which had already
made the Middle Ages so interesting, we must bear in mind
that the pioneer neurotic of those days had at his command a
number of disguises and evasions to which his fellow-sufferer
of to-day can no longer have recourse. One of his favourite
expedients for concealing his neurotic maladjustment was to
take refuge in some form of religion or rather in some new
variation of religious belief or practice, for it is, of course,
not claimed here that religion itself can be exhaustively explained
as a manifestation of nervous maladjustment. But the
colonial period was an era when it was still good form, so
to speak, for a neurosis to express itself in some religious
peculiarity, and as this was a country without monasteries
(which had proved to be such a haven for the neurotically
afflicted during the Middle Ages), the neurotic was forced to
exhibit his neo-religionism in the open. Often he blossomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
forth in some new form of religious segregation, which allowed
him to compensate for his social defect and often gave him
positive advantages.</p>

<p>The neurotic legacy which he thus bequeathed to the nation
can still be seen all around us to-day in the extraordinary
multiplicity of religious variations, not to say eccentricities,
which dot the theological heavens in America. For the neurotic
as a religion founder—or better, inventor—quickly gathered
similarly inclined adherents, formed a sect, and moved a
little further West, so that the country was rather plentifully
sown with strange creeds. He was thus freed from the criticism
which would have overtaken him in a more settled society
and his neurotic disguise remained undetected to a degree
no longer possible to-day. For if nowadays we still occasionally
encounter a brand-new and crassly individual religion all
registered and patented like any temperance elixir, we usually
discover that its prophet is either a defective or even an illiterate
person who has distorted some biblical text in favour of
a bizarre interpretation, or else a psychopathic individual who
already has highly systematized ideas of the delusioned type.
This class of neurotic has tended to disappear by somewhat
the same process through which the more flamboyant type of
hysteric such as flourished in the Middle Ages has gradually
succumbed to progressive exposure—an analogy to which I
refer with some diffidence in the face of one of the supreme
ironies of the 20th century, namely, the canonization of Joan
of Arc. But that lapse into the darkness of mediævalism is
probably to be explained as a by-product of the war mind.</p>

<p>The other great loophole for the early American neurotic
was purely geographical. He could always move on. In view
of the tendency towards social avoidance so characteristic of
the neurotic, this was of inestimable advantage. It is, of
course, generally supposed that when the embryonic American
trekked Westward it was either in response to some external
pressure of political oppression or religious intolerance or to
the glad, free call of wider horizons and more alluring opportunities,
as was the case with the earliest colonists in their flight
from Europe. In both cases, however, the assumption may be
challenged as a sufficient explanation. For it is extremely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
probable that a good many of these pioneers were, like Mr.
Cohan’s “Vagabond,” fugitives from their own thoughts quite
as much as from the tyranny of others. They felt an urge
within them that made a further abidance in their social environment
intolerable. This geographical flight of the neurotic
has always been the most natural and the most obvious,
checked though it is to-day to a large extent by the disappearance
of further virgin territory and the sophistication born
of the knowledge wrought by a world-wide intercommunication
which says that mankind is everywhere much the same, a truth
which can again be translated into an internal realization that
we cannot escape from ourselves.</p>

<p>Certainly our pioneers have been too much romanticized.
The neurotic legacy which they bequeathed to us can plainly
be seen in many characteristics of our uncouth Westerners with
their alternate coldness towards visitors and their undignified
warmth towards the casual stranger who really cannot mean
anything to them. There is something wrong about man as a
social animal when he cannot live happily in a valley where
he sees more than the distant smoke of his neighbour’s chimney.
When at last the pressure of population forces him to
live socially his suspicion and distrust are likely to turn him
into a zealot and reformer and make possible the domination
in American life of such a sub-cultural type as Bryan or the
beatitudes of a State like Kansas. The favourite Western
exhortation to be able to look a man in the eye and tell him
to go to Hell is worthy of an anti-social community of ex-convicts,
and the maxim about minding your own business can
only be understood as a defence against the prevalent tendency
of everybody to mind his neighbour’s business. Thus the self-isolating
neurotic ends by revenging himself upon society by
making it intolerable.</p>

<p>But this is to anticipate. It must be said that until after
the Civil War America remained singularly free from “nerves.”
This is perhaps largely due to the fact, as I have tried to show,
that they were not known as such. The only serious epidemic
was the witchcraft hunting of the 17th century. It is certainly
most charitable towards a religion which had so many other
repellent features to characterize this as an hysterical epidemic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
and let it go at that, though it also freshly illustrates the time-worn
truth that intolerance does not seem to make its victims
any more tolerant in their turn. The passing of this epidemic
also marked the last irruption of State intolerance towards religion,
with the exception of later incidents in connection with
the Mormon Church, though it has rarely been understood that
especially in this country State tolerance of religion was compensated
for by individual and social intolerance in matters
that quite transcended the religious sphere. The vast importance
of this phenomenon in relation to our modern nervous
tension will be referred to again later on.</p>

<p>The first typical manifestation of American nerves on an
imposing scale began to develop in the sixties and seventies of
the last century in the form of neurasthenia. Until then the
typical American, despite his religious obsessions and his social
deficiencies, had, to a large extent, remained externally minded,
a fact which is sufficiently attested by his contempt for the
arts and his glorification of his purely material achievements.
He had been on the make, an absorbing process while it lasts,
though rather dangerous in the long run because it never comes
to an end. Neurasthenia developed rapidly as soon as it had
been properly labelled, and claimed a notable number of victims
among our captains of industry and high-pressure men:
indeed, the number might easily lead to the perhaps rather
unkindly conclusion that business dishonesty, even though successful,
is likely to result in nervous breakdown in a generation
piously reared on the unimpeachable maxims of a Benjamin
Franklin or a Herbert Smiley. More fundamentally
it was, of course, the logical penalty for cultivating the purely
energetic side of man at the expense of his contemplative nature.
The philosophy of hurry and hustle had begun to totter.</p>

<p>The discoverer, expounder, and popularizer of neurasthenia
was Doctor George M. Beard, under whose ægis neurasthenia
came to be known as “the American disease.” Dr. Beard
was a sound neurologist within the limits of his generation
of medicine, but with a dangerous gift of imagination. His
conception of neurasthenia was truly grandiose. According
to him this fascinating disease was endemic in the United
States and was the result of our peculiar social conditions. Its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
cause, he claimed, was “modern civilization, which has these
five characteristics—steam power, the periodical press, the
telegraph, the sciences, the mental activity of women.” Among
the secondary and tertiary causes of neurasthenia or nervousness
he threw in such things as climate, the dryness of our
air and the extremes of heat and cold, civil and religious liberty,
our institutions as a whole, inebriety, and the general
indulgence of our appetites and passions. In a remarkable
chapter he also assigned as one of the causes of our nervousness
the remarkable beauty of American women, though he
does not clearly state whether this made only the men nervous
or the women as well. Such a diagnosis was to turn sociologist
with a vengeance and Doctor Beard lived up to his implications
by saying that the cure of neurasthenia would mean “to
solve the problem of sociology itself.”</p>

<p>The inevitable result of such a broad and confident diagnosis
was to make of neurasthenia a kind of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">omnium gatherum</i> of
all the ills of mankind less obvious than a broken leg. To
explain the affliction in terms of America rather than in terms
of the patient and his symptoms had about the value of a foreigner’s
book about America written on his home-bound
steamer after a six-weeks’ sojourn in this country. In fact,
the wildest diagnoses were made, and such perfectly well-defined
medical entities as tabes, arteriosclerosis, parathyroidism,
myasthenia, and incipient tumours of the brain were frequently
given the neurasthenic label. Various theories of
exhaustion and nervous strain were also advanced and the
attempt was made to feed and strengthen the nervous system
directly on the analogy of Professor Agassiz’s famous assumption
that the phosphates in fish could be directly absorbed as
material for brain-cells, a theory which did not account for
the fact that comparatively few intellectual giants have sprung
from fisher-folk. This naturally opened up a wide field for
quackery and ushered in the era of “nerve tonics” which are
still with us to-day. The craze for sanitariums also started at
about this time, and with every doctor having a little sanitarium
of his own the public was pretty well fleeced both by
its “medicine men” and its men of medicine.</p>

<p>Of course no treatment could possibly be successful in curing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
such a wide variety of diseases the very existence of many
of which was hidden from the physician under the blanket
term of neurasthenia; and in those cases where an actual neurasthenia
was present the treatment as developed by Beard
and his followers made only superficial progress. The S. Weir
Mitchell formula, for instance, with its emphasis upon quiet,
diet, and rest, remained, in the majority of cases, essentially
a treatment of symptoms rather than of causes. The tired
and over-wrought business man was given a pacifying vacation
from his dubious labours and was then promptly sent back
to them, like a dog to his vomit. The American woman, grown
nervous from being insufficiently occupied, was initiated into
a different form of doing nothing, whereat she felt much relieved
for a time. Neurasthenia was soon moving in a vicious
and ever-widening circle; the more it spread the more it had
to include and thus became less and less digested medically;
it played havoc especially among American women who exploited
their “nervousness” much as their European sisters
had exploited their “migraine” or their “vapours” in previous
generations. By the nineties, however, neurasthenia had run
its course as a fashionable affliction, other countries had succeeded
in surviving without erecting a quarantine against it,
and medical circles had begun to debate whether there was
such a thing as neurasthenia at all.</p>

<p>But, despite the breakdown of neurasthenia and the sins
that were committed in its name, it would be a mistake to be
merely amused at Doctor Beard for the pretentiousness of his
concept or to criticize him too severely for being too much of
a medical popularizer. His insight was, after all, of considerable
value. For he realized, however imperfectly, that the
neuroses as a class are cultural diseases and that they cannot
be properly understood without taking into account the background
of modern civilization. This is a rare virtue in American
medicine where the specialist is constantly in danger of
isolating himself, a tendency which is particularly harmful in
the study of the mental sciences. Unfortunately Doctor Beard
did not follow through. He seems to have become frightened
at his own diagnosis. For no sooner had he drawn the worst
possible picture of American civilization as a breeder of neurasthenia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
than he turned around and assured the public that
things were not so bad after all. He accomplished this by
enriching his sociology with a philosophy which is a prodigy
in itself. This philosophy of his he called the “omnistic philosophy”
and claimed for it the peculiar virtue of being able to
include “optimism on the one hand and pessimism on the
other and make the best of both,” which is undoubtedly as
uplifting a piece of American metaphysics as one is likely to
find on the whole Chautauqua circuit. In criticizing the slow
advance of American medicine as a whole it is always well to
remember the atmosphere of intellectual quackery in which
our physicians no less than our early metaphysicians so confidently
moved.</p>

<p>By the end of the 19th century the study of functional nervous
disorders in America was, as I have said, pretty well strewn
with the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">disjecta membra</i> of neurasthenia which still breathed
slightly under the stimulus of electro- and hydrotherapeutics
and of the “health foods” industry. Meanwhile hypnotism
also had come to do its turn upon the American medical stage,
where it ran through a swift cycle of use and abuse. Neurology
as a special department, like the rest of American medicine,
had been greatly enriched by contact with continental
medicine, and the works of Kraepelin had come into honour
among the psychiatrists. Dr. Morton Prince had begun to
publish some interesting studies of double personalities, and
a number of tentative systems of psycho-therapy based on a
rather mixed procedure had been set up only to be knocked
down again as a beneficial exercise for the critical faculty.</p>

<p>But now the stage was set for the appearance of the two
modern theories of the neuroses as presented in Europe by
Janet and Freud. In the rivalry that immediately ensued between
these two opposing theories that of Janet was soon outdistanced.
His fundamental conception of hysteria as a form
of degeneration was in a way quite as repugnant to American
optimism as the sexual interpretation of Freud was to American
prudery. Janet had indeed been of invaluable help to
the hysteric by taking him seriously, but his presentation of
the subject was so narrow and his theory in the end proved
so static that his views have made little headway. Janet was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
also under the disadvantage of working as an isolated figure
in a prescribed field and did not come into any revolutionary
relation to psychology as a whole or find those immensely suggestive
analogies in the field of psychiatry, especially in dementia
præcox and paranoia, which have given the work of Freud
such a wide range. He had, besides, the defects common
to so much of French medicine which is often so peculiarly
insular and, so to speak, not made for export. His contribution
more or less began and ended with the theory of the dissociation
of the personality which is not characteristic of hysteria
alone and could not successfully be grafted upon the old
psychology to which Janet clung.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Freud after an initial resistance rapidly
became epidemic in America. As was the case in Europe, he
enjoyed considerable vogue among the lay public while still
violently opposed in medical circles. His visit to America,
however, in 1909, on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary
of Clark University, created a very favourable impression and
brought him to the attention of such American psychologists as
William James, Edwin B. Holt, Adolf Meyer, and others. His
works appeared in this country in translations by Doctor A. A.
Brill, and in a short while Freud was “taken up” with a
vengeance.</p>

<p>He has had both the advantages and the handicaps of a
boom. His admirers have obscured or exaggerated him and
his enemies have derided his popularity as proof of a reputation
based upon sensationalism. In fact, Freud met with three
fates: he was either wildly embraced, or rejected in toto with
an appropriate academic lynching, or else he was accepted with
“improvements.”</p>

<p>He was fortified by previous experience against the second
alternative and probably resigned to the third: it was the embrace
that most nearly proved fatal to him. For America
was to see the most extravagant development of the so-called
“wild” psychoanalysis, a danger against which Freud himself
had issued a warning. In 1916, for instance, an informal
canvas revealed that approximately five hundred individuals
were quite willing to psychoanalyze patients in the city of New
York alone, whereas there were probably not more than six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
properly qualified medical practitioners in the whole State.
Advertisements offered to teach the psychoanalytic technique
by mail and instructors in chiropractic included it in their
curriculum. This gross abuse was due to the general laxness
of medical law in this country which still remains to be remedied.
It was not only the amateurs that offended; doctors
themselves were often at fault. For it cannot be too often
emphasized that a psychoanalyst must have something more
than the conceit of psychological subtlety common to most of
us; he must be a trained neurologist and must have had considerable
experience in psychiatry if he would escape the pitfalls
of differential diagnosis—a case of hysteria can be dangerously
like an incipient tumour of the brain and a compulsion-neurosis
may simulate a paranoid condition. These abuses are, of
course, no criticism of the intrinsic value of psychoanalysis.
It has been the history of so many medical discoveries that
they are recommended as a cure-all; we need but recall vaccination,
or the present vitamine craze. On the other hand, it
is regrettable that the direct attack upon Freud in this country
has rarely risen above the level of denunciation. Quite recently,
for instance, one of our socially eminent neurologists
allowed himself to indulge in the teleological, or rather disguised
theological, argument that if the unconscious is really
so full of dreadful things as Freud says, they should be left
there. And yet it is just serious and sympathetic criticism
of which the science of psychoanalysis stands most in need.</p>

<p>The attempts to assimilate Freud were of two kinds. The
first of these, like Professor Holt’s book on “The Freudian
Wish” or Doctor Edward J. Kempf’s “The Autonomic Functions
and the Personality,” were sincere attempts of critical
dignity to relate psychoanalysis to American behaviouristic psychology
on the part of men who are not altogether professed
Freudians. The second were more in the nature of somewhat
pompous criticisms which attempted to reconcile and soften
what seemed to be the more repellent features of the Freudian
theories. There is a prevalent tendency among medical men
in America to indulge in criticism without any due regard to
the proportions between the magnitude of a subject and their
familiarity with it, somewhat after the manner of the green<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
theological student who is confident of his ability to subvert
the theory of evolution in a casual thesis of his own. The
scientist in many fields is constantly facing this debasement of
standards, making science not too scientific or logic not too
logical lest it should be misunderstood; it is certainly a commentary
that the majority of Americans, for instance, look
upon Edison as our greatest scientist. The tendency to
sweeten and refine Freud has taken some peculiar forms, due,
in great part, to Doctor Jung who, on having re-introduced
the libido theory to American audiences with a number of
philosophical and mystical trimmings of his own, felt that he
had made Freud more palatable over here.</p>

<p>Ironically enough, it would have been a very simple matter
to “put over” Freud in this country with all the éclat of the
Bergsonian craze which just preceded him. It was merely
a question of the right kind of publicity, for the problem of
how to handle sex in America has been solved long ago. The
way to do it is to sentimentalize it. If Freud, instead of saying
that the incestuous longing of the child for the parent of
opposite sex is a natural impulse, though normally sublimated
during the period of adolescence, had put the same idea into
the phraseology of so many of our popular songs which reiterate
the theme about mother being her boy’s first and last
and truest love, he would have encountered no opposition.
And if he had given his theory of the unconscious a slightly
religious setting by emphasizing the fact that the unconscious
has no sense of the passage of time and cannot conceive its
own annihilation, he would have been hailed as the latest
demonstrator of the immortality of the soul. A little personal
press-agenting to the effect that he led a chaste life and was
the father of a flourishing family would have completed the
prescription. He would have gone over with a bang, though
he probably would have been quite as amiably misunderstood
as he is now viciously misunderstood.</p>

<p>Freud, however, presented his case at its own value and,
aside from informing an astonished American audience that
Doctor Sanford Bell had preceded him in announcing the preadolescent
sexuality of children, shouldered the responsibility
for his theories. What he has said, carefully and repeatedly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
is that ever since, for a long period in our development, the
difficulties of satisfying the hunger impulse have been overcome
in so far as civilized man has pretty well solved the problem
of nutrition; it is the sex impulse to which the individual
has the greatest difficulty in adjusting himself. This difficulty
increases rather than decreases with the advance of culture
and at certain stages leads to the group of diseases known
as the neuroses. In a normal sexual life there is no neurosis.
But our civilization has in many ways become so perverse that
we find something akin to an official preference for a neurosis
rather than a normal sexual life, in spite of the fact that the
neurosis ultimately will destroy civilization. This is the
vicious circle which Freud attacked. In doing so he had first
to enlarge the concept of sexuality and show its complex relation
to our whole culture. In studying civilization at its breaking
point he naturally had to study what was breaking it up,
namely, the individual’s maladjustment to his sexual impulses.
But he has never attempted to sexualize the universe, as has
been claimed, nor has he ever lost sight of the fact that while
man as an egocentric being must put the self-regarding instincts
first, man regarded as one of the processes of nature
remains to be studied in terms of his reproductive instincts.
Freud has been persistently oversexualized both by his admirers
and his opponents, and the degree to which this has
been done in America is at least some indication of how close
he has come home to conditions here.</p>

<p>Freudian research in this country has been limited almost
entirely to cases. Our physicians who practise psychoanalysis
have lacked either the leisure or the culture to apply their
science to wider cultural questions to which the Freudian
psychology applies, and among the lay scholars using the
psychoanalytic technique there has been no outstanding figure
like that of Otto Rank who has done such notable work in
Vienna. But the study of specific cases of hysteria and
neurosis as they occur in America already permit of some
general conclusions as to the character of the national matrix
from which they spring. One of the most striking features
of our emotional life is the exaggerated mother-love so frequently
displayed by Americans. The average American,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
whether drunk or sober, can grow maudlin about his mother’s
perfections and his devotion to her in a way that must shock
the European observer. Not that the European loves his
mother less: it is simply that he is more reticent about expressing
an emotion which he feels has a certain private sanctity;
he would experience a decided constraint or αἰδώς in
boasting about it, just as a woman of breeding would not
parade her virtue. The American adult knows no such restraint;
he will “tell the world” how much he loves his
mother, will sing sentimental songs about her and cheerfully
subscribe to the advice to “choose a girl like your mother
if you want to be happily married,” and then grows violent
when the incest-complex is mentioned. This excessive mother
worship has reached almost cultic proportions. It is reflected
in our fiction, in our motion-pictures, in the inferior position
of the American husband, and in such purely matriarchal religions
as Christian Science where a form of healing is practised
which is not very far removed from a mother’s consolation
to her boy when he has bruised his knees. All this points to
a persistent sexual infantilism and an incomplete sublimation,
which are such fertile breeders of hysteria. One is involuntarily
reminded of Doctor Beard’s rather enigmatic statement
that the extraordinary beauty of our women is one of the
causes of nervousness in America. In so far as they offer a
maximum of enticement with a minimum of conjugal satisfaction
the charge is certainly justified. It is as if they did not
even know their own business in terms of their sexual function
of weaning their husbands from their mothers and thus
completing the necessary exogamic process. We thus have the
condition where the husband, in further seeking to overcome
his incest-complex, becomes everything in his business and
nothing in his home, with an ultimate neurotic breakdown or
a belated plunge into promiscuity. The wife, on her part,
either becomes hysterical or falls a victim to religious or reformatory
charlatanism.</p>

<p>The study of compulsion-neuroses and allied paranoid states
which are so prevalent among us has given us further insights
into the neurotic character of the American temperament.
One of the most valuable of these is the recognition of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
compulsive nature of so much of our thinking. This has also
been well observed by a foreign critic like Santayana who says
of America, “Though it calls itself the land of freedom, it is
really the land of compulsions, and one of the greatest compulsions
is that we must think and feel alike.” This is a
rather fatal indictment of our boasted individualism, which is,
as a matter of fact, an individualism born of fear and distrust
such as already marked our early pioneers. We are indeed
ultra-conformists, and our fear of other-mindedness amounts
almost to a phobia. But such an atmosphere constitutes a
paradise for the compulsion-neurotic because he finds it easy
to impose his compulsions upon the rest of society. The fact
that compulsion-neurotics are constantly indulging in neo-religious
formations through which they are enabled temporarily
to accommodate their taboos and phobias in religious
ceremonials, enables them to make use of the general religious
sanctions of society in order to impose their compulsions upon
their fellow-beings.</p>

<p>Herein probably lies a better explanation of American intolerance
than in the indictment of Puritanism which furnishes
such a favourite invective for our iconoclasts. Puritanism
has become a literary catchword and by no means covers
the case. For it must be remembered that we are dealing with
offshoots of deteriorated religions which spring from a very
wide range of individuals. Religion, having been cut off from
direct interference with the State, and having gradually lost
its primitive anthropomorphism which really was one of its
sources of strength, proceeded to project itself more and more
outwardly upon social questions. As the personality of God
grew dim the figure of the Devil also lost its vividness and
the problem between good and evil could not longer be fought
out entirely in the individual’s own bosom; he was no longer
tempted by the figure of the Devil appearing to him in person.
Christian religion in its prime saw very clearly that the soul
must put its own salvation to the fore, and constantly used
many apt similes, such as the beam in our own eye, to remind
us that while our neighbour might also have his hands full in
fighting the Devil, he probably was capable of taking care of
himself. Our modern reformer has no use for any such simile;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
he would have to go out of business if he could not keep picking
at the mote in his neighbour’s eye. He finds the equivalent
of the Devil in our social vices, in alcohol, in tobacco, in tea
and coffee, in practically all forms of amusements. He
preaches a crusade which no longer has an ideal object, and
enlists a vague religious emotion which is inaccessible to reason
and mocks intellectual criticism. The device of using religious
associations as carriers of propaganda has often been
used for political purposes with consummate skill. Bryan’s
famous Cross of Gold speech and Roosevelt’s Armageddon
appeal are excellent examples of it.</p>

<p>The question has often arisen why the fanatical reformer
is so omnipotent in America. Why does he succeed so well
in imposing his compulsions upon others? Why are we so
defenceless against his blackmail? Why, in plain language,
do we stand for him? Foreign observers have frequently
commented upon the enormous docility of the American public.
And it is all the more curious because ordinarily the average
American prides himself upon his assertiveness and his
quickness in detecting false pretensions. Yet it is a common
occurrence to meet people with valid claims to hard-headedness
who nevertheless submit to every form of compulsion. They
do not believe in prohibition but vote for it, they smoke but
think smoking ought to be stopped, they admit the fanatical
nature of reform movements and yet continue their subscriptions.</p>

<p>In giving what can at best be only a partial answer to this
national enigma, we may briefly consider two types which profoundly
contribute to our atmosphere of compulsion: our immigrant
and our native aristocrat. The first, from the very
nature of the case, becomes the victim of compulsion, while
the second imposes the compulsion and then in turn, however
unwillingly, succumbs to it himself. Our society, with its
kaleidoscopic changes of fortune and its unchannelled social
distinctions, presents a problem of adjustment with which even
those who are at home in America find it difficult to cope.
People on the make, people who are not sure of themselves
on a new social ladder, are likely to conform: we find an astonishing
amount of social imitation, in its milder and more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
ludicrous form, in all our pioneer communities. The immigrant
faces the same problem to an intensified degree. He
comes to us in an uprooted state of mind, with many of his
emotional allegiances still lingering in his native country, and
often with an entirely alien tradition. His mind is set to conform,
to obey at first without much asking. He is like a
traveller arriving in a strange town who follows the new traffic
directions even though he does not understand their purpose.
But even with the best of will he cannot entirely conform.
He finds himself in a new world where what formerly seemed
right to him is now considered wrong, his household gods have
lost their power, his conscience is no longer an infallible guide.
It is a sign of character in him to resist, to refuse to sink his
individuality entirely, to struggle somewhat against the democratic
degradation which threatens to engulf him too suddenly.
But his struggle leads to a neurotic conflict which is often not
resolved until the third generation. It is thus quite permissible
to talk of an immigrant’s neurosis, which has considerable
sociological importance even though it does not present an
integral clinical picture. It leads either to the formation of
large segments of undigested foreigners in American society
who sullenly accept the forms we impose upon them while
remaining comparatively inarticulate in our cultural and political
life, or else it produces a type of whom our melting-pot
romanticists are foolishly proud, the pseudo-American who
has sunk from individualism to the level of the mob, where he
conforms to excess in order to cover his antecedents and becomes
intolerant in order that he may be tolerated.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, the mob tyranny which has become such an
alarming feature of our public life would be checked by the
aristocratic element in society. It is part of the aristocratic
function to foster cultural tolerance and to resist herd suggestion:
the aristocratic or dominant type, in enjoying the most
privileges, is normally least subject to compulsions and taboos.
With us that is not the case. The Southerner, for instance,
our most traditional aristocrat, finds himself paralyzed by the
consciousness of a black shadow behind him who constantly
threatens both his political and his sexual superiority. He
moves in an atmosphere of taboos from which he himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
cannot escape, for it is an established fact that interdiction
in one line of thought has a crippling effect upon a man’s
intellectual activity as a whole. Elsewhere our native aristocrat
frequently finds himself in the position of a lonely outpost
of a thin Anglo-Saxon tradition which he must defend against
the constant onslaughts of alien civilizations, in the desperate
attempt to uphold the fiction that spiritually, at least, we are
still an English colony. He is in a state of tension where he
himself cannot move with any of the freedom which he vaunts
as one of the outstanding characteristics of the country of his
fathers. In his hands his own latest hope, our war-born
Americanization programme, which should really be an initiation
into freedom, has quickly become little more than a forced
observance of sterile rites with which to impress the alien.
He already sees its failure, and, like a general who is afraid of
his own army, he does not sleep very well.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MEDICINE">MEDICINE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">From</span> time immemorial the doctor has been the object of
respect and awe by the generality of mankind. It is true
that he has occasionally been made the butt of the satirical
humour of such dramatists as Molière and Shaw, but the
majority of people have regarded these jests as amiable buffooneries,
and not as penetrating criticisms. In ancient days
the veneration of the medico was based upon his supposed
association with gods and devils, and upon the belief that he
could cure disease by wheedling propitiation of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">deus</i>, or by
the exorcism of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">diabolus</i>. In modern times he holds sway by
his supposed possession of the secrets of science.</p>

<p>In spite of his pretension to scientific attainment, many
vestiges of his former priesthood remain, and this <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mélange</i> of
scientist and priest has produced curious contradictions and
absurdities. But these absurdities must by an inexorable law
remain concealed from all save a few, and the general failure
to recognize them has led to a great increase in the importance
and prosperity of the medical cult. In America, of all
civilized nations, medical magnificence has reached its most
formidable proportions. This exaggeration, characteristic of
all social phenomena in the new world, makes the real importance
of the doctor to society easy to inspect and to analyze.</p>

<p>A friend not long ago asked me to explain the co-existence,
in the same city, of the elaborate installation of the Harvard
Medical School and the magnificent temple of the religion
of Mrs. Eddy. “What is it in our culture,” said he, “that
permits the symbol of such obvious quackery as that of Mrs.
Eddy to flourish within a stone’s throw of such an embodiment
of scientific enlightenment as the medical college?”</p>

<p>I replied that the reason for this must be sought in the gullibility
of our citizens, who are capable of entertaining most incompatible
and contradictory credos. Thus, the average
American can believe firmly and simultaneously in the therapeutic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
excellence of yeast, the salubrious cathartic effects of
a famous mineral oil, the healing powers of chiropractors,
and in the merits of the regimen of the Corrective Eating
Society. His catholicity of belief permits him to consider
such palpable frauds seriously, and at the same time to admire
and respect authentic medical education and even the scientific
study of disease. But the teachers, students, and alumni
of medical colleges are drawn from our excessively credulous
populace. So it is dangerous to consider the votaries of the
profession of medicine as sceptical and open-minded <em>savants</em>,
in contrast to the promulgators of the afore-mentioned imbecilities
and to <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Homo sapiens americanus</i>, who is the unconscious
victim of such charlatanry. In reality the great majority
of the medical profession is credulous and must always
remain so, even in matters of health and disease.</p>

<p>The tendency to consider physicians in general as men of
science is fostered by the doctors themselves. Even the most
eminent among them are guilty in this respect. Thus the
Director of the Hospital of the Rockefeller Institute maintains
that medicine must be considered not as an applied science
but as an independent science (R. Cole, <cite>Science</cite>, N. S., Vol. LI,
p. 329). And an eminent ex-President of the American Medical
Association holds a similar view, at the same time preposterously
asserting that “medicine has done more for the
growth of science than any other profession, and that its best
representatives have been among the leaders in the advancement
of knowledge....” (V. C. Vaughan, <cite>Journal</cite>, A. M. A.,
1914, Vol. LXII, p. 2003.)</p>

<p>Such pronunciamentoes rest upon the almost universal confusion
of the <em>art</em> of the practice of medicine with the <em>science</em>
of the study of disease. Science, in its modern definition,
is concerned with the quantitative relationship of the factors
governing natural phenomena. No favourites are to be played
among these factors. They are to be weighed and measured
meticulously and coldly, without enthusiasm for one, or disdain
and enmity toward another. Now, in the case of relationship
of doctor to patient, it is clear that such emotions must
enter. The physician must entertain enthusiasm for the defensive
powers of his patient, John Smith, and at the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
time hate virulently the pneumococcus that attacks him. This
emotional state of the soldier of health prevents the employment
of what is known in the language of the laboratory as
the “control.” For example, a doctor wishes to test the
efficacy of a serum against pneumonia. In America it is
practically unknown for him to divide his cases of pneumonia
into two groups of equal size, to administer his serum to group
A and to leave group B untreated. He almost invariably has
a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">parti-pris</i> that the serum will work, and he reflects with horror
that if he holds his remedy from group B, some members
of this group will die, who might otherwise have been saved.
So he injects his serum into all of his patients (A and B), and
if the mortality in the entire group appears to him to be lower
by statistics than that observed in previous series of cases,
he concludes that the value of his nostrum is proved. This
is an illustration of the fallacy of the notion that medicine is
a science in the modern sense.</p>

<p>Modern study of disease, conducted in the laboratory upon
experimental animals, has furnished medical practitioners with
a few therapeutic and prophylactic weapons. In the use of
these the American medico has not lagged behind his European
colleague. But the great majority of the malaises that
plague us are not amenable to cure, and it is with these that
the doctor has since the beginning of time played his most
important rôle, i.e., that of a “professional sympathizer.” The
encouraging conversation with the family of the sufferer; the
mumbling of recondite Latin phrases; the reassuring hopeful
hand on the patient’s shoulder; the grave use of complicated
gimcracks; the prescription of ineffective but also innocuous
drugs or of water tinted to pleasing hues; all these are of
incalculable value to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ménage</i> stricken by disease. It is
my lamentable duty to point out the danger of the decline of
this essential rôle among the doctors of America. The general
practitioner of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ancien régime</i> was sincere in his performance
of his quasi-religious function. He was unsparing of
his energies, stern in his devotion to duty, deeply altruistic
in sentiment, and charmingly negligent in economic matters.</p>

<p>But at the present time this adorable figure is disappearing
from the land, to be replaced by another, more sinister type,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
actually less learned in the important folklore of the bedside,
pseudo-scientific, given to rigidly defined office hours, and painfully
exact in the extortion of his emolument. What are the
factors that give rise to the appearance of this new figure on
the American scene? The most important of these is to be
found in the high development of the craft of surgery in the
United States. Of all the dread afflictions that plague us, a
few may be cured or ameliorated by the administration of
remedies, and an equally small number improved or abolished
by surgical interference. But in spite of the relatively few
diseases to which surgery is beneficial, the number of surgeons
that flourish in the land is enormous. The fundamental discoveries
of Pasteur and their brilliant application by Lister
were quickly seized upon in America. The names of Bull,
Halstead, Murphy, the brothers Mayo, Cushing, and Finney
are to be ranked with those of the best surgeons of any nation.
In fact, we may be said to lead the world—to use an apt
Americanism—in the production of surgeons, just as we do in
that of automobiles, baby carriages, and antique furniture.</p>

<p>The success of these protagonists in the higher carpentry
at once attracted a horde of smaller fry, imitators, men of inferior
ability. The rapid advances made by the leaders resulted
in the development of a diversified and complicated technic,
which the ordinary surgeon was able to master in sections
but not <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in toto</i>. From this, specialization in surgery has developed
rapidly and naturally, so that now certain men devote
their lives exclusively to the enthusiastic and indiscriminate
removal of tonsils, others are death on gall bladders, some the
foes of the vermiform appendix, and yet others practise exclusively
the radical cure of phimosis. It is obvious that such
narrow specialization, practised in isolation, would lead to
most amusing results, which may best be left to the imagination.
But these absurdities were finally apparent even to the
surgeons themselves, with the resulting development of what
is now known as “group medicine.”</p>

<p>In brief, surgeons with special <em>penchants</em> for the removal of
various organs, form partnerships, calling to their aid the internist
for the diagnosis of their prospective victims. The
internist gathers about him, in turn, a group of less important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
fry, known as radiographers, bacteriologists, pathologists, and
serologists. Frequently a dentist is added to the coterie. The
entire organization is welded into a business partnership of
typically American efficiency. These groups are forming over
the entire nation, are appearing even in the tank-towns of
the hinterland. They occupy elegant suites in important
office buildings, their members are generally considered the
arbiters of the medical opinion of the community. Their more
or less intelligent use of the paraphernalia of pathology, bacteriology,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">et cetera</i>, gives them an enormous advantage over
their more humble brother, the general practitioner. This
last, indeed, is being rapidly routed in his battle with such
associations of “best minds,” equipped with the armamentarium
of modern science.</p>

<p>The remuneration required by the “super-docs” of group
medicine is naturally far in excess of that demanded by the
general practitioner. It is right that this should be so, if not
for the results obtained, then by reason of the elaborate organization
and expensive equipment that the group system
demands. This increase in reward has made the profession
of medicine in America what it never was before, a paying
proposition—again to use an apt Americanism. The result
of this entry of crass materialism into a previously free-and-easy,
altruistic, anything but business-like profession is, once
more, better left to the imagination than described. The
brigandage of many of these medical banditti is too painful
even to think about. It will be apparent that relatively few
of our citizens are able to pay for group medicine. So, it is
interesting to observe that the best in medical treatment and
advice is accessible only to the highest and lowest castes of
our plutocracy. The rich receive this at the elegant offices
and private hospitals of the groups, the miserably poor at the
teaching hospitals of medical colleges.</p>

<p>The service of the “super-doc” to such of our citizens as
can afford him cannot at this time be properly estimated. It
is true that he is progressive, that he leans heavily upon the
subsidiary sciences of pathology, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">et cetera</i>, that he publishes
papers in medical periodicals, that he visits medical libraries,
frequents medical congresses. It has just been insisted that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
the doctor has benefitted himself to a great extent economically
by forming the group; it is for the future to divulge whether
his ministrations have resulted in a perceptible reduction of
human suffering or in a prolongation of human life. Certainly
he has perpetrated some astounding hoaxes, the kind-hearted
will say unwittingly. Probably the most interesting
of these is to be observed in the focal infection mania just
now subsiding.</p>

<p>Focal infection came into prominence as the theory, so
called, of a group of eminent physicians in Chicago. It is, in
brief, the doctrine that many of our aches and pains whose
direct etiology it is impossible to demonstrate are due to the
presence in the body of foci of harmful microbes, at the roots
of the teeth, in the tonsils, accessory sinuses, or the appendix.
Discover the focus, remove it, and presto!—the ache disappears
like the card up the sleeve of the expert American poker
player. The advantages of this theory to the various specialists
of a group will be obvious. To illustrate. Henry Doolittle
is plagued by a persistent and annoying pain over his
left shoulder-blade. He goes to the office of a group of
“super-docs,” is referred to the diagnostician, who makes a
careful record of his <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">status præsens</i>, then orders his satellites
to perform the Wassermann reaction, make the luetin test, do
differential blood counts, perform the determination of his
blood urea, and carry out a thorough chemical study of his
basal metabolism. If the results of these tests show no departure
from the normal, or if they seriously contradict each
other, the cause of the pain is probably focal infection. The
patient is then subjected to examination by X-ray, his teeth
are pulled by the dentist, his tonsils excised by the otolaryngolist,
who also takes a swipe, in passing, at his accessory
sinuses, and should these mutilations fail to relieve him, his
appendix is removed by the abdominal surgeon. If relief
still fails to occur, the theory is not given up, but the focus is
presumed to exist elsewhere. If Mr. Doolittle’s patience is
equal to the test, and if his purse is not by this time completely
empty, additional operations are advised. These continue
until all organs and appendages not actually necessary to
mere existence have been removed. Henry then returns to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
his former mode of life, depleted and deformed, it is true, but
occasionally minus his original pain. It is not the intention
to deny that infected teeth and tonsils have no significance in
pathology. But it is certain that their importance has been
greatly exaggerated by many physicians. The question needs
more investigation, with fewer preconceived ideas. The “science”
underlying this astounding practice is admirably outlined
in the book of Billings called “Focal Infection.” It
is the most striking example of medical <em>Ga-Ga-ism</em> that has
appeared in our country. It is, as its author himself admits,
a triumph of the new idea of team-work and co-operative research
in medicine. The factors giving rise to this lamentable
<em>Ga-Ga</em> are the gullibility of patient and doctor, the emotional
element entering into the interpretation of all of the phenomena
observed by the physician, commercialism, and, finally, the
self-limiting nature of most disease.</p>

<p>So much for the Art of Healing as practised by the physicians
of America. What of our activities in the second aim of
medicine, that is, the prevention of disease? While superficial
examination is enough to lay bare the many hollow pretensions
of the practice of medicine, it would appear <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i>
that the work of disease prevention might at least approach
the category of the applied sciences. This would seem to be
so, since the greater part of this field must of necessity concern
itself with infectious disease. Now the etiologic agents of the
majority of infectious diseases are known. It is easy to see
that the labour of their prevention rests upon an exact knowledge
of the nature of the disease-producing microbes, the
analysis of the delicate balance between the virulence of the
microbic invader and the resistance of the human host, and,
most important of all, upon the exact path by which the
germ in question travels from one individual to another.</p>

<p>In the early days of preventive medicine, following shortly
upon the fundamental researches of Pasteur, several important
contributions were made by Americans. These include
the brilliant investigations of Theobald Smith on the etiology
and mode of transmission of the Texas fever of cattle, and,
later on, the differentiation of bovine and human tuberculosis.
America had again reason to be proud when, in 1901, Reed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
Carroll, Agramonte, and Lazear demonstrated that yellow
fever was spread exclusively by the mosquito, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ædes calopus</i>.
These investigators showed a beautiful spirit of self-sacrifice
and devotion to their science. The construction of the Panama
Canal was made possible by the application of these
researches by Gorgas. Again, the American Russell was the
first to show that vaccination against typhoid and allied infections
is feasible. In the New York Board of Health, Park,
Krumwiede, and their associates have made careful and valuable
studies on the prevention of diphtheria. These constitute
the high lights of American achievement in preventive
medicine. It must be admitted that the majority of these
examples are to be placed in the category of the science of the
study of disease, rather than in that of its application—preventive
medicine.</p>

<p>It is noticeable even by cursory survey of recent American
work that such striking achievements have become distinctly
fewer in recent years, despite an enormous increase in personnel,
equipment, and money devoted to the prevention of
disease. Along with this decrease in solid contributions there
has been an augmentation of fatuous propaganda and windy
theory. All of the judicious must view this tendency with
alarm and sadness, since it seemed for a time that science was
really about to remove the vestigia of witchcraft and high-priesthood
from this branch of medicine at least.</p>

<p>What is the cause of this retrogression? It must be laid
at the door of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Religio Sanitatis</i>, the Crusade of Health. This
is one of the most striking examples of the delusion of most
Americans that they are the Heaven-appointed uplifters of
the human race. Just as all Baptists, Presbyterians, and
Methodists deprecate the heathen happiness of the benighted
Oriental, so the International Health Board seeks to mitigate
his contented squalour and to eradicate his fatalistically born
disease. Just as Billy Sunday rages against John Barleycorn
and the Dionysians who worship him, so the Great Hygienists
seek to point out the multiform malaises arising from such
worship. Just as the now extinct Wilson strove to show the
world that it was horrid and wrong to fight, so the Public
Health Service seeks to propagate the notion that chastity and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
adherence to marital vows are the sole alternatives to a universal
syphilization.</p>

<p>Thus we observe with horror the gradual replacement of
those Nestors of preventive medicine who had the dispassionate
view of science, and who applied its methods of cold
analysis, by a group of dubious Messiahs who combine the
zealous fanaticism of the missionary with the Jesuitical
cynicism of the politician. For most of the organizations for
the promotion of health are closely dependent upon state and
municipal politics, and must become contaminated with the obscenity
of political practice. Finally, it is apparent that the
great privately endowed foundations are animated by the spirit
of proselytism common to the majority of religions, but especially
to Baptists. It will be objected that such charges are
vague generalizations. It is necessary, therefore, to bring
forward one or two specific instances in support of these
contentions.</p>

<p>The soldiers of the recent successful campaign for national
prohibition were supported by battalions of noted hygienists
who made excellent practice with a heavy artillery of so-called
scientific evidence upon the confused ranks of brewers, distillers,
and their customers, the American bibuli. What is
the value of their “scientific evidence”? Two charges are
made against the use of alcohol as a beverage. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Primo</i>, that
its moderate or excessive use is the direct cause of various
maladies. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Secondo</i>, that the children of alcoholic parents are
often deformed, degenerates, or imbeciles, and that such lamentable
stigmata are the direct results of the imbibitions of their
parents.</p>

<p>Now it is vain to argue that alcohol, taken in great excess,
is not injurious. Mania a potu (Korsakow’s disease) is
without doubt its direct result, at least in some instances. On
the other hand, excessive indulgence in water is also not without
its harmful effects, and I, for one, would predict evil
days for our Great Commoner, should he so far lose control
of himself as to imbibe a gallon of grape juice <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">per diem</i>.
Many enthusiastic hygienists advance the opinion that alcohol
is filling our insane asylums! This generalization is a gorgeous
example of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">post hoc propter hoc</i> reasoning, and is based<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
upon the idiotic statistical research which forms so large a
part of the activity of the minions of public health. The
recent careful work of Clouston and others tends more and
more to indicate that chronic alcoholics do not go crazy because
they drink, but become alcoholics because they already
were crazy, or had the inherited tendency toward insanity.
This embarrassing fact is carefully suppressed by the medico-hygienic
heavy artillerists of the prohibition army. What is
more, diseases with definite pathologic pictures, such as cirrhosis
of the liver, have by no means been definitely proved to be
caused by alcohol. Indeed, the researches of Friedenwald,
who endeavoured to produce such effects by direct experiment,
have led to negative results.</p>

<p>The second indictment, i.e., that alcoholism in parents
causes degenerate offspring, rests upon still more dubious scientific
foundations. The most important animal experimentation
in this field is that of Stockard, who used guinea-pigs
as his subjects, and of Pearl, who had recourse to chickens.
Both of these researches are sound in scientific method. Unfortunately
for hygienists, they lead to completely contradictory
conclusions. Stockard and his collaborators found the
offspring of alcoholic guinea-pigs to be fewer in number than
those of his normal controls. What is more, the children of
the alcoholics were frequently smaller, had a higher post-natal
mortality, and were prone to suffer from epileptiform convulsions.
These results brought forth <em>banzais</em> from the hygienists
and were extensively quoted, though their application by analogy
to the problems of human heredity is not to be made too
hastily.</p>

<p>Pearl, on the other hand, discovered that while the number
of offspring from his inebriated chickens was distinctly fewer,
yet these were unquestionably superior to normal chickens in
eight of the twelve hereditary characters amenable to quantitative
measurement. Now if one can generalize Stockard’s results
to human beings, then it is equally permissible to do the
same with Pearl’s. Of the two, the latter generalization would
be preferable, and of greater benefit to the human race, were
the analogy valid. For who will not whoop for “fewer children,
but better ones”? Do the votaries of preventive medicine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
place the results of Pearl along side of those of Stockard?
Indeed, who even mentions Pearl’s results at all? If satisfactory
evidence is adduced that this has been done, I hereby
promise to contribute one hundred dollars in cash toward the
foundation of a home for inebriated prohibition agents. Again,
while much is heard of the results of Bezzola in regard to the
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Rauschkinder</i> resulting from the Swiss bacchanalia, the negative
findings of Ireland in similar investigations of the seasonal
debauches of Scotland are carefully avoided. Once more, Elderton
and Karl Pearson have failed utterly to find increase
in the stigmata of degeneracy among the children of alcoholic
parents as compared with those of non-alcoholics. This research,
published in a monograph of the Francis Galton Laboratory
of London, is the one really careful one that has been
made in the case of human beings. It was directed by Pearson,
admittedly a master of biometrical science. Yet, turning
to Rosenau’s “Preventive Medicine and Hygiene,” the bible of
this branch, I find the Elderton-Pearson report relegated to a
footnote in the edition of 1913, <em>and omitted completely from
the 1920 edition</em>.</p>

<p>A discussion of the fatuity to which American preventive
medicine descends cannot be terminated without touching upon
the current propaganda of the syphilophobes. For just as
practitioners of medicine exploit human credulity, so the preventers
of disease play upon the equally universal instinct of
fear. There is no intention of minimizing the seriousness of
syphilis. Along with cancer, pneumonia, and tuberculosis, it
is one of the major afflictions of humanity. It causes thousands
of deaths yearly; it leads to great misery. Paresis, one of the
important psychoses, is definitely known to be one of its manifestations.
It is obvious, therefore, that its eradication is one
of the major tasks of social hygiene.</p>

<p>But by what means? Let one of the most noted of our
American syphilophobes give the answer! This gentleman, a
professor of pathology in one of the most important medical
schools of the Middle West, yearly lectures over the length
and breadth of the land on the venereal peril. He begins his
expostulation with reduction of his audiences to a state of terror
by a lantern-slide display of the more loathsome manifestations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
of the disease. He does not state that modern treatment
makes these more and more rare. He insists upon the
utter impossibility of its cure, a fact by no means established.
He advocates early marriage to a non-syphilitic maiden as the
best means of prevention, and failing that, advises that chastity
is both possible and salubrious. Then follows a master
stroke of advice by innuendo—<em>the current belief that masturbation
causes insanity is probably untrue</em>. Finally he denies
the value of venereal prophylaxis, which was first experimentally
demonstrated by Metchnikoff and Roux, and
which the medical department of the Army and Navy know
to be of almost perfect efficacy when applied early and
thoroughly.</p>

<p>Lack of space prevents the display of further examples of
the new phenomenon of the entrance of religion and morals into
medicine. It is not my intention for a moment to adopt a
nihilistic attitude toward the achievement of preventive medicine.
But it is necessary to point out that its contamination
by moralism, Puritanism, proselytism, in brief, <em>by religion</em>,
threatens to reduce it to absurdity, and to shake its authority
in instances where its functions are of unmistakable value to
our republic. At present the medical profession plays a minor
rôle in the more important functions of this branch. These
are performed in the first place by bacteriologists who need
not be doctors at all, and in the second by sanitary engineers,
whose splendid achievements in water supply and sewage disposal
lead those of all other nations.</p>

<p>It has been remarked above that one of the chief causes of
the unscientific nature of medicine and the anti-scientific character
of doctors lies in their innate credulity and inability to
think independently. This contention is supported by the report
on the intelligence of physicians recently published by the
National Research Council. They are found by more or less
trustworthy psychologic tests to be the lowest in intelligence
of all of the professional men excepting only dentists and
horse doctors. Dentists and horse doctors are ten per cent.
less intelligent. But since the quantitative methods employed
certainly carry an experimental error of ten per cent. or even
higher, it is not certain that the members of the two more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
humble professions have not equal or even greater intellectual
ability. It is significant that engineers head the list in intelligence.</p>

<p>In fact, they are rated sixty per cent. higher than doctors.
This wide disparity leads to a temptation to interesting psychological
probings. Is not the lamentable lack of intelligence
of the doctor due to lack of necessity for rigid intellectual
discipline? Many conditions conspire to make him an intellectual
cheat. Fortunately for us, most diseases are self-limiting.
But it is natural for the physician to turn this dispensation
of nature to his advantage and to intimate that <em>he</em> has
cured John Smith, when actually nature has done the trick.
On the contrary, should Smith die, the good doctor can assume
a pious expression and suggest that, despite his own incredible
skill and tremendous effort, it was God’s (or Nature’s)
will that John should pass beyond. Now the engineer is open
to no such temptation. He builds a bridge or erects a building,
and disaster is sure to follow any mis-step in calculation
or fault in construction. Should such a calamity occur, he is
presently discredited and disappears from view. Thus he is
held up to a high mark of intellectual rigour and discipline that
is utterly unknown in the world the doctor inhabits.</p>

<p>A survey of the present condition of American medical education
offers little hope for a higher intellectual status of the
medical profession or of any fundamental tendency to turn
medicine as a whole from a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mélange</i> of religious ritual, more
or less accurate folk-lore, and commercial cunning, toward the
rarer heights of the applied sciences.</p>

<p>Such a reform depends absolutely upon the recognition that
the bodies of all the fauna of the earth (including <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Homo
sapiens</i>) are essentially physico-chemical mechanisms; that
disease is a derangement of one sort or another of this mechanism;
and that real progress in knowledge of disease can only
come from quantitatively exact investigation of such derangements.</p>

<p>Up to the present, the number of professors in any branch
of medicine who are aware of this fact is pitifully few. The
men, who, being aware of it, have the training in physics and
chemistry to put their convictions into practice are less in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
number. So, it is vain to hope that medical students are being
educated from this point of view.</p>

<p>This casual glance at American medicine may be thought
to be an unduly pessimistic one. It has not been my intention
to be pessimistic or to be impertinently critical. Indeed,
turning from the art of the practice of medicine, and the religion
and folk-lore of sanitation, to the science of the study of
disease, we have much of which to be proud. American biochemists
of the type of Van Slyke and Folin are actually in the
lead of their European brothers. Their precise quantitative
methods furnish invaluable tools in the exact study of the ills
that afflict us.</p>

<p>Finally, the greatest figure of all, Jacques Loeb, working in
an institution that declares its purpose to be the dubious one
of <em>medical</em> research, has in the last three years published investigations
which throw a flood of light upon the dark problems of
the chemistry of proteins. His work is of most fundamental
significance, will have far-reaching results, and is measurably
in advance of that of any European in the same field. Loeb,
like all men of the first rank, has no spirit of propaganda or
proselytism. His exact quantitative experiments rob biology
of much of its confused romantic glamour. The comprehension
of his researches demands thorough knowledge of physical
chemistry. However, it is encouraging to note that among
a few younger investigators his point of view is being accepted
with fervour and enthusiasm. But it is time to stop. We are
straying from our subject which was, if I remember, American
medicine.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SPORT_AND_PLAY">SPORT AND PLAY</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Bartlett</span> does not tell us who pulled the one about all
work and no play, but it probably was the man who said
that the longest way round was the shortest way home. There
is as much sense in one remark as in the other.</p>

<p>Give me an even start with George M. Cohan, who lives in
Great Neck, where I also live, without his suspecting it—give
us an even start in the Pennsylvania Station and route me on
a Long Island train through Flushing and Bayside while he
travels via San Francisco and Yokohama, and I shall undertake
to beat him home, even in a blizzard. So much for “the
longest way round.” Now for the other. If it were your ambition
to spend an evening with a dull boy, whom would you
choose, H. G. Wells, whose output indicates that he doesn’t
even take time off to sleep, or the man that closes his desk at
two o’clock every afternoon and goes to the ball-game?</p>

<p>You may argue that watching ball-games is not play. It is
the American idea of play, which amounts to the same thing,
and seventy-five per cent, of the three hundred thousand citizens
who do it daily, in season, will tell you seriously that it
is all the recreation they get; moreover, that deprived of it,
their brain would crack under the strain of “business,” that,
on account of it, they are able to do more work in the forenoon,
and do it better, than would be possible in two or three
full days of close sticking on the job. If you believe them,
inveterate baseball fans can, in a single morning, dictate as
many as four or five twenty-word letters to customers or salesmen,
and finish as fresh as a daisy; whereas the non-fan, the
grind, is logy and torpid by the time he reaches the second
“In reply to same.”</p>

<p>But if you won’t concede, in the face of the fans’ own statement,
that it is recreation to look on at baseball or any other
sport, then let me ask you to invite to your home some evening,
not a mere spectator, but an active participant in any of
our popular games—say a champion or near-champion golfer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
or a first string pitcher on a big league baseball club. The
golfer, let us say, sells insurance half the year and golfs the
rest. The pitcher plays eight months of the year and loafs the
other four. Bar conversation about their specialty, and you
won’t find two duller boys than those outside the motion-picture
studios.</p>

<p>No, brothers, the bright minds of this or any other country
are owned by the men who leave off work only to eat or go to
bed. The doodles are the boys who divide their time fifty-fifty
between work and play, or who play all the time and don’t
even pretend to work. Proper exercise undoubtedly promotes
good health, but the theory that good health and an active
brain are inseparable can be shot full of holes by the mention
of two names—Stanislaus Zbyzsk and Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

<p>It is silly, then, to propound that sport is of mental benefit.
Its true, basic function is the cultivation of bodily vigour, with
a view to longevity. And longevity, despite the fact that we
profess belief in a post-mortem existence that makes this one
look sick, is a thing we poignantly desire. Bonehead and wise
guy, believer and sceptic—all of us want to postpone as long
as possible the promised joy-ride to the Great Beyond. If to
participate in sport helps us to do that, then there is good
reason to participate in sport.</p>

<p>Well, how many “grown-ups” (normal human beings of
twenty-two and under need not be considered; they get all
the exercise they require, and then some) in this country, a
country that boasts champions in nearly every branch of athletics,
derive from play the physical benefit there is in it?
What percentage take an active part in what the sporting editors
call “the five major sports”—baseball, football, boxing,
horse racing, and golf? Let us take them one by one and figure
it out, beginning with “the national pastime.”</p>

<p><i>Baseball.</i> Twenty or twenty-one play. Three hundred to
forty thousand look on. The latter are, for two hours, “out
in the open air,” and this, when the air is not so open as to give
them pneumonia and when they don’t catch something as bad
or worse in the street-car or subway train that takes them
and brings them back, is a physical benefit. Moreover, the
habitual attendant at ball-games is not likely to die of brain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
fever. But otherwise, the only ones whose health is appreciably
promoted are the twenty or twenty-one who play. And
they are not doing it for their health.</p>

<p><i>Football.</i> Thirty play. Thirty thousand look on. One or
two of the thirty may be killed or suffer a broken bone, but
the general health of the other twenty-nine or twenty-eight is
improved by the exercise. As for the thirty thousand, all they
get is the open air—usually a little too much of it—and, unless
they are hardened to the present-day cheer-leader, a slight
feeling of nausea.</p>

<p><i>Boxing.</i> Eight to ten play. Five thousand to sixty thousand
look on. Those of the participants who are masters of defence
may profit physically by the training, though the rigorous
methods sometimes employed to make an unnatural weight
are certainly inimical to health. The ones not expert in defensive
boxing, the ones who succeed in the game through their
ability to “take punishment” (a trait that usually goes with
a low mentality) die, as a rule, before reaching old age, as a
result of the “gameness” that made them “successful.”
There is a limit to the number of punches one can “take”
and retain one’s health. The five or sixty thousand cannot
boast that they even get the air. All but a few of the shows
are given indoors, in an atmosphere as fresh and clean as that
of the Gopher Prairie day-coach.</p>

<p><i>Horse Racing.</i> Fifty horses and twenty-five jockeys play.
Ten thousand people look on. I can’t speak for the horses, but
if a jockey wants to remain a jockey, he must, as a rule, eat a
great deal less than his little stomach craves, and I don’t know
of any doctor who prescribes constant underfeeding as conducive
to good health in a growing boy.</p>

<p>Racing fans, of course, are out for financial, not physical,
gain. They, like the jockeys, are likely to starve to death
while still young.</p>

<p><i>Golf.</i> Here is a pastime in which the players far outnumber
the lookers-on. It is a game, if it is a game, that not only
takes you out in the open air, but makes you walk, and walking,
the doctors say, is all the exercise you need, if you walk
five miles or more a day. Golf, then, is really beneficial, and
it costs you about $25.00 a week the year round.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span></p>

<p>So much for our “five major sports.” We look on at four
of them, and if we can support the family, and pay taxes and
insurance, on $1250 a year less than we earn, we take part in
the fifth.</p>

<p>The minor sports, as the editor will tell you, are tennis,
boating, polo, track athletics, trap-shooting, archery, hockey,
soccer, and so on. Not to mention games like poker, bridge,
bowling, billiards, and pool (now officially known as “pocket
billiards” because the Ladies’ Guild thought “pool” must
have something to do with betting), which we may dismiss as
being of doubtful physical benefit, since they are all played
indoors and in a fog of Camel smoke.</p>

<p>Of the outdoor “minors,” tennis is unquestionably the most
popular. And it is one whale of a game—if you can stand it.
But what percentage of grown-ups play it? I have no statistics
at hand, and must guess. The number of adult persons
with whom I am acquainted, intimately or casually, is possibly
two thousand. I can think of ten who play as many as five
sets of tennis a year.</p>

<p>How many of the two thousand play polo or have ever
played polo? One. How many are trap-shooters? Two.
How many have boats? Six or seven. How many run footraces
or jump? None. How many are archers? None. How
many play hockey, soccer, la crosse? None.</p>

<p>If I felt like indulging in a game of cricket, which God forbid,
whom should I call up and invite to join me?</p>

<p>Now, how many of my two thousand acquaintances are occasional
or habitual spectators at baseball games, football
games, boxing matches, or horse races? All but three or four.
The people I know (I do not include ball-players, boxers, and
wrestlers, who make their living from sport) are average
people; they are the people you know. And the overwhelming
majority of them don’t play.</p>

<p>Why not? If regular participation in a more or less interesting
outdoor game is going to lengthen our lives, why don’t
we participate? Is it because we haven’t time? It takes just
as much time to look on, and we do that. Is it because we
can’t afford it? We can play tennis for as little as it costs to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
go to the bail-game and infinitely less than it costs to go to
the races.</p>

<p>We don’t play because (1) we lack imagination, and because
(2) we are a nation of hero-worshippers.</p>

<p>When we were kids, the nurse and the minister taught us
that, if we weren’t good, our next stop would be hell. But, to
us, there was no chance of the train’s starting for seventy
years. And we couldn’t visualize an infernal excursion that
far off. It was too vague to be scary. We kept right on swiping
the old man’s cigars and giggling in the choir. If they had
said that misdemeanours such as those would spell death and
eternal fire, not when we were old, but to-morrow, most of
us would have respected father’s property rights and sat
through the service with a sour pan. If the family doctor were
to tell us now that unless we got outdoors and exercised every
afternoon this week, we should die next Tuesday before lunch,
you can bet we should get outdoors and exercise every afternoon
this week. But when he tells us that, without healthful outdoor
sport, we shall die in 1945 instead of 1949, why, it doesn’t
mean anything. It’s a chimera, a myth, like the next war.</p>

<p>But hero-worship is the national disease that does most to
keep the grandstands full and the playgrounds empty. To
hell with those four extra years of life, if they are going to cut
in on our afternoon at the Polo Grounds, where, in blissful
asininity, we may feast our eyes on the swarthy Champion of
Swat, shouting now and then in an excess of anile idolatry,
“Come on, you Babe. Come on, you Baby Doll!” And if
an hour of tennis is going to make us late at the Garden, perhaps
keep us out of our ringside seats, so close to Dempsey’s
corner that (O bounteous God!) a drop of the divine perspiration
may splash our undeserving snout—Hang up, liver!
You’re on a busy wire!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HUMOUR">HUMOUR</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">With</span> the aid of a competent bibliographer for about five
days I believe I could supply the proof to any unreflecting
person in need of it that there is no such thing as an
American gift of humorous expression, that the sense of
humour does not exist among our upper classes, especially our
upper literary class, that in many respects almost every other
civilized country in the world has more of it, that quiet New
England humour is exceedingly loud and does not belong to
New England, that British incomprehension of our jokes is as
a rule commendable, the sense of humour generally beginning
where our jokes leave off. And while you can prove anything
about a race or about all races with the aid of a bibliographer
for five days, as contemporary sociologists are now showing, I
believe these things are true. Belief in American humour is
a superstition that seldom outlasts youth in persons who have
been exposed to American practice, and hardly ever if they
know anything of the practice elsewhere. Of course I am not
speaking of the sad formalism of the usual thing as we see it
in newspapers and on movie screens or of the ritual of magazines
wholly or in part sanctified to our solemn god of fun. I
mean the best of it.</p>

<p>In the books and passages collated by my bibliographer the
American gift of humour would be distributed over areas of
time so vast and among peoples so numerous, remote, or savage,
that no American would have the heart to press his claim.
The quaintness, dryness, ultra-solemnity with or without the
wink, exaggeration, surprise, contrast, assumption of common
misunderstanding, hyperbolical innocence, quiet chuckle, upsetting
of dignity, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">éclat</i> of spontaneity with appeals to the everlasting,
dislocation of elegance or familiarity, imperturbability,
and twinkle—whatever the qualities may be as enumerated by
the bacteriologists who alone have ever written on the subject,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
the most American of them would be shown in my bibliographer’s
report to be to a far greater degree un-American. Patriotic
exultation in their ownership is like patriotic exultation
in the possession of the parts of speech. Humour is no more
altered by local reference than grammar is altered by being
spoken through the nose. And if the bibliography is an ideal
one it will not only present American humour at all times and
places but will produce almost verbatim long passages of
American humorous text dated at any time and place, and will
show how by a few simple changes in local terms they may be
made wholly verbatim and American. It will show that American
humorous writing did in fact begin everywhere but only
at certain periods was permitted to continue and that these
periods were by no means the happiest in history. I have time
to mention here only the laborious section that it will probably
devote to Mark Twain in the Age of Pericles, though for
the more active reader the one on Mr. Cobb, Mr. Butler, and
others around the walls of Troy might be of greater contemporary
interest.</p>

<p>Mark Twain, according to the citations in this section, would
seem actually to have begun all of his longer stories, including
“Pudd’nhead Wilson,” and most of the shorter ones, essays,
and other papers, at Athens or thereabouts during this period,
but not to have finished a single one, not even the briefest of
them. He started, gave a clear hint as to how the thing would
naturally run, and then he stopped. The reason for this was
that owing to the trained imagination of the people for whom
he wrote, the beginning and the hint were sufficient, and from
that point on they could amuse themselves along the line that
Mark Twain indicated better than he would have amused
them, had he continued. Mark Twain finally saw this and
that is why he stopped, realizing that there was no need of his
keeping the ball rolling when to their imaginative intelligence
the ball would roll of itself. He did at first try to keep on,
and being lively and observant and voluble even for a Greek
he held large crowds on street-corners by the sheer repetition
of a single gesture of the mind throughout long narratives of
varied circumstance. In good society this was not tolerated
even after supper, and there was never the slightest chance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
publication. But the streets of Athens were full of the suppressed
writings of Mark Twain.</p>

<p>Every man of taste in Athens loved Mark Twain for the
first push of his fancy but none could endure the unmitigated
constancy of his pushing of it, and as Mark Twain went everywhere
and was most persistent, the compression of his narrative
flow within the limits of the good breeding of the period
was an embarrassing problem to hosts, unwilling to be downright
rude to him. Finally he was snubbed in public by his
friends and a few of the more intimate explained to him afterwards
the reason why.</p>

<p>The gist of their explanation was evidently this: The hypothesis
of the best society in town nowadays is that the prolongation
of a single posture of the mind is intolerable, no
matter how variegated the substance in which the mind reposes.
That sort of thing belongs to an earlier day than ours,
although, as you have found, it is still much relished in the
streets. If all the slaves were writers; if readers bred like
rabbits so that the pleasing of them assured great wealth; if
the banausic element in our life should absorb all the rest of
it and if, lost in the external labour process, with the mechanism
of it running in our minds, we turned only a sleepy eye
to pleasure; then we might need the single thought strung with
adventures, passions, incidents and need only that—infinitudes
of detail easily guessed but inexorably recounted; long lists of
sentiments with human countenances doing this and that;
physiological acts in millions of pages and unchanging phrase;
volumes of imaginary events without a thought among them;
invented public documents equalling the real; enormous anecdotes;
and all in a strange reiterated gesture, caught from machines,
disposing the mind to nod itself to sleep repeating the
names of what it saw while awake. But the bedside writer for
the men in bed is not desired at the present moment in our
best society.</p>

<p>All these things are now carried in ellipsis to the reader’s
head, if the reader’s head desires them; they are implied in
dots at ends of sentences. We guess long narratives merely
from a comma; we do not write them out. In this space left
free by us with deliberate aposiopesis, a literature of countless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
simplicities may some day arise. At present we do not feel the
need of it. And in respect to humour the rule of the present
day is this: never do for another what he can do for himself.
A simple process of the fancy as in contrast, incongruity, exaggeration,
impossibility, must be confined in public to one or
two displays. Let us take the simplest of illustrations—a cow
in the dining-room, for example—and proceed with it as simply
as we can. If by a happy stroke of fancy a cow in the dining-room
is made pleasing to the mind, never argue that the pleasure
is doubled by the successive portrayal of two cows in two
dining-rooms, assuming that the stroke of fancy remains the
same. Realize rather that it diminishes, and that with the
presentation of nine cows in nine dining-rooms it has changed
to pain. Now if for cows in dining-rooms be substituted gods
in tailor shops, tailors in the houses of gods, cobblers at
king’s courts, Thebans before masterpieces, one class against
another, one age against another, and so on through incalculable
details, however bizarre, all in simple combination, all easily
gathered, without a shift of thought or wider imagery, the fancy
mechanistically placing the objects side by side, picked from
the world as from a catalogue—even then the situation to our
present thinking is not improved.</p>

<p>“Distiktos,” said they, playfully turning the name of the
humourist into the argot of the street, “we find you charming
just at the turn of the tide, but when the flood comes in, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ne
Dia!</i> you are certainly <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">de trop</i>. And in your own private interest,
Distiktos, unless you really want to lead a life totally
anexetastic and forlorn, how can you go on in that manner?”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap a"><span class="smcap1">A little</span> less than two years ago—on the 14 July, 1919,
to be exact—it fell to my lot, as an officer attached to
one of the many military missions in Paris, to “assist,” from
a reserved seat in a balcony of the Hotel Astoria, at the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">défilé</i>,
or triumphal entry of the Allied troops into Paris.</p>

<p>The march <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à Berlin</i> not having eventuated owing to the upset
in schedule brought about by the entry of dispassionate
allies at the eleventh hour, it was felt that the French must
be offered something in exchange, and this took the happy
form of a sort of community march along the route once desecrated
by Prussian hoof-beats—a vast military <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corbeille</i> of the
allied contingents, with flags, drums, trumpets, and all the rest
of the paraphernalia that had been kept in cold storage during
four years of gas, shell, and barbed wire. Such a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">défilé</i>, it was
calculated, would be something more than a frugal gratification
to the French army and people. It would offer to the
world at large, through the medium of a now unmuzzled press,
a striking object lesson in allied good feeling and similarity of
aims.</p>

<p>My purpose in referring to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">défilé</i> is merely to record one
unrehearsed incident in it but I would say in passing that the
affair, “for an affair,” as the French say, was extraordinarily
well stage-managed. A particularly happy thought was the
marshalling of the allied contingents by alphabetical order.
This not only obviated any international pique on what we
all wanted to be France’s day, but left the lead of the procession
where everybody, in the rapture of delivery, was well content
it should remain. Handled with a little tact, the alphabet
had once more justified itself as an impartial guide:</p>

<p class="in0 in4">
B is for Britain, Great.<br />
A is for America, United States of.
</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>For impressiveness I frankly and freely allot the palm to
what it was the fashion then to term the American effort. Different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
contingents were impressive in different ways. The Republican
Guard, jack-booted, with buckskin breeches, gleaming
helmets, flowing <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">crinières</i>, and sabres <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au clair</i>, lent just the right
subtle touch of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">épopée</i> of Austerlitz and Jena to make us
feel 1871 had been an evil dream; the Highlanders, the voice
of the hydra squalling and clanging from their immemorial
pipes, stirred all sorts of atavistic impulses and memories.
Nevertheless, had I been present that day in Paris as a newspaper
man instead of as the humblest and most obscure of soldiers,
neither one nor the other would have misled my journalistic
instinct. I should have put the lead of my “story”
where alphabetical skill had put the lead of the procession—in
the American infantry.</p>

<p>In front the generalissimo, martial and urbane, on a bright
coated horse that pranced, curvetted, “passaged” from side to
side under a practised hand. At his back the band, its monster
uncurved horns of brass blaring out the Broadway air before
which “over there” the walls of pacifism had toppled into dust
in a day. Behind them, platoon by platoon, the clean shaved,
physically perfect fighting youth of the great republic. All six
feet high—there was not one, it was whispered, but had earned
his place in the contingent by a rigorous physical selection:
moving with the alignment of pistons in some deadly machine—they
had been drilled, we were told, intensively for a month
back. In spotless khaki, varnished trench helmets, spick and
span, scarcely touched by the withering breath of war. Whenever
the procession was checked, platoon after platoon moved
on to the regulation distance and marked time. When it
resumed, they opened out link by link with the same almost
inhuman precision, and resumed their portentous progress.
How others saw them you shall hear, but to me they were
no mere thousand fighting men; rather the head of a vast
battering ram, the simple threat of which, aimed at the over-taxed
heart of the German Empire, had ended war. A French
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">planton</i> of the Astoria staff, who had edged his way into the
ticketed group was at my back. “Les voilà qui les attendaient,”
he almost whispered. “Look what was waiting for
<em>them</em>.”</p>

<p>The next balcony to mine had been reserved for the civil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
employés of British missions, and here was gathered a little
knot of average English men and women—stenographers, typists,
clerks, cogs of commercialism pressed into the mechanical
work of post-war settlement. As the Americans moved on
after one of the impressive checks of which I have just spoken,
something caught my ears that made me turn my head quickly,
even from a spectacle every lost moment of which I grudged.
It was, of all sounds that come from the human heart, the
lowest and the most ominous—the sound that makes the unwary
walker through tropical long grass look swiftly round his
feet and take a firmer grasp on the stick he has been wise
enough to carry.</p>

<p>It is impossible—it is inconceivable—and it’s true. On this
great day of international congratulation, one of the two
branches of the Anglo-Saxon race was hissing the other.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>I spoke about the matter later to a friend and former
chief, whom I liked but whose position and character were no
guarantee of tact or good judgment. I said I thought it rather
an ominous incident, but he refused to be “rattled.” With
that British imperturbability which Americans have noted and
filed on the card index of their impressions he dismissed the
whole thing as of slight import.</p>

<p>“Very natural, I dare say. Fine show all the same. Perhaps
your friends on the other balcony thought they were
slopping over in front.”</p>

<p>“‘Slopping over...?’”</p>

<p>“Well—going a little too far. Efficiency and all that. Bit
out of step with the rest of the procession.”</p>

<p>I have often wondered since whether this homely phrase, uttered
by a simple soldier man, did not come nearer to the root
of the divergence between British and American character
than all the mystifying and laborious estimates which nine out
of ten of our great or near-great writers seem to think is due
at a certain period in their popularity.</p>

<p>To achieve discord, you see, it is not necessary that two instruments
should play different tunes. It is quite sufficient
that the tempo of one should differ from the tempo of the other.
All I want to indicate in the brief space which the scope of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
this work, leaves at my disposal are just a few of the conjunctures
at which I think the beat of the national heart, here and
across the Atlantic, is likely to find itself out of accord.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Englishmen do not emigrate to the United States in any
large numbers, and it is many years since their arrival contributed
anything but an insignificant racial element to the
“melting pot.” They do not come partly because their own
Colonies offer a superior attraction, and partly because British
labour is now aware that the economic stress is fiercer in the
larger country and the material rewards proportionately no
greater. Those who still come, come as a rule prepared to take
executive positions, or as specialists in their several lines.
Their unwillingness to assume American citizenship is notorious,
and I think significant; but it is only within quite recent
years that it has been made any ground of accusation—and
among the class with which their activities bring them into
closest contact it is, or was until a year or two ago, tacitly and
tactfully ignored. During a review of the “foreign element”
in Boston to which I was assigned two years before the war, I
found business men of British birth not only reluctant to yield
“copy” but resentful of the publicity to which the enterprise
of my journal was subjecting them.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why eminent English writers and
publicists are of little value in arriving at an estimate of “how
Americans strike an Englishman.” While not asserting anything
so crude as that commercial motives are felt as a restraining
force when the temptation arises to pass adverse judgment
on the things they see and hear, it is evident that the conditions
under which they come—men of achievement in their
own country accredited to men of achievement here—keep
them isolated from much that is restless, unstable, but vitally
significant in American life. None of them, so far as I know,
have had the courage or the enterprise to come to America,
unheralded and anonymous, and to pay with a few months
of economic struggle for an estimate that might have real
value.</p>

<p>To this lack of real contact between the masses in America
and Great Britain is due the intrinsic falsity of the language<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
in which the racial bond is celebrated on the occasions when
some political crisis calls for its reiteration. It is felt easier
and safer to utter it in consecrated <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">clichés</i>—to refer to the
specific gravity of blood and water, or the philological roots
of the medium used by Milton and Arthur Brisbane. The
banality, the insincerity, of the public utterances at the
time that America’s entry into the European struggle first
loomed as a possible solution of the agony on the Western
Front was almost unbelievable. Any one who cares to turn
up the files of the great dailies between September, 1916, and
March, 1918, may find them for himself.</p>

<p>To a mind not clouded by the will to believe, this constant
invocation of common aims, this perpetual tug at the bond to
ensure that it has not parted overnight, would be strong corroboration
of a suspicion that the two vessels were drifting apart,
borne on currents that flow in different directions. It is not
upon the after-dinner banalities of wealthy and class-conscious
“pilgrims” nor the sonorous platitudes of discredited laggards
on the political scene, still less is it upon the sporting proclivities
of titled hoydens and hawbucks to whom American
sweat and dollars have arrived in a revivifying stream, that
we shall have to rely should the cable really part and the two
great vessels of State grope for one another on a dark and uncharted
sea. It is upon the sheer and unassisted fact of how
American and Englishman like or dislike one another.</p>

<p>It is a truism almost too stale to restate that we are standing
to-day on the threshold of great changes. What is not so
well realized is that many of these changes have already taken
place. The passing of gold in shipment after shipment from
the Eastern to the Western side of the Atlantic and the feverish
hunt for new and untapped sources of exploitation are only the
outward signs of a profound European impoverishment in
which Britain for the first time in her history has been called
upon to bear her full share. The strikes and lock-outs that
have followed the peace in such rapid succession might possibly
be written off as inevitable <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sequelæ</i> of a great war. The
feeble response to the call for production as a means of salvation,
the general change in the English temper faced with its
heavy task are far more vital and significant matters. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
seem to mark a shift in moral values—a change in the faith
by which nations, each in the sphere that character and circumstance
allot, wax and flourish.</p>

<p>Confronted with inevitable competition by a nation more
populous, more cohesive, and richer than itself, it seems to me
that there are three courses which the older section of the
English race may elect to follow. One is war, before the
forces grow too disparate, and on the day that war is declared
one phase of our civilization will end. It will really not matter
much, to the world at large, who wins an Anglo-American
world conflict. The second, which is being preached in and
out of season by our politicians and publicists, who seldom,
however, dare to speak their full thought, is a girding up of
the national loins, a renewed consecration to the gospel of effort,
a curtailment, if necessary—though this is up to now
only vaguely hinted—of political liberties bestowed in easier
and less strenuous days. The third course may easily be
guessed. It is a persistence in proclivities, always latent as I
believe in the English temperament, but which have only revealed
themselves openly since the great war, a clearer questioning
of values till now held as unimpeachable, a readier ear
to the muttering and murmuring of the masses in Continental
Europe, internationalism—revolution. No thoughtful man in
England to-day denies the danger. Even references to that
saving factor, the “common sense of the British workman,”
no longer allays the spectre of a problem the issues of which
have only to be stated to stand forth in all their hopeless irreconcilability.
Years ago, long before the shadow fell on the
world, in a moment of depression or inspiration, I wrote that
cravings were stirring in the human heart on the very eve of
the day when the call would be to sacrifice. That is the riddle,
nakedly stated, to which workers and rulers alike are asked
to find an answer to-day.</p>

<p>In this choice that lies before the British worker a great
deal may depend upon how American experiments and American
achievements strike him. In England now there is no
escaping from the big transatlantic sister. Politicians use her
example as a justification; employers hold up her achievements
as a reproach. A British premier dare not face the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
House of Commons on an “Irish night” unequipped with
artful analogies culled from the history of the war of secession.
The number of bricks per hour America’s bricklayers will lay
or the tons of coal per week her stolid colliers will hew are
the despair of the contractor face to face with the loafing and
pleasure-loving native born. You will hear no more jokes
to-day in high coalition places over her political machine replacing
regularly and without the litter and disorder of a general
election tweedledum Democrat by a tweedledee Republican.
She is recognized—and this, I think, is the final value
placed upon her by the entire ruling and possessing classes in
my own country—as better equipped in her institutions, her
character, and her population for the big economic struggle
that is ahead of us.</p>

<p>This is the secret of the unceasing court paid to Washington
by all countries, but pre-eminently by Britain. It is not
fear of her power, nor hunger for her money bags and harvests,
nor desire to be “on the band-wagon,” as light-hearted
cartoonists see it, that prompts the nervous susceptibility and
the instantaneous response to anything that will offend those
in high places on the banks of the Potomac. It is the sense,
among all men with a strong interest in maintaining the present
economic order, that the support in their own countries is
crumbling under their hands, and that that fresh support,
stronger and surer, is to be found in a new country with a
simpler faith and a cleaner, or at any rate a shorter, record.
To fight proletarianism with democracy is a method so obvious
and safe that one only wonders its discovery had to wait upon
to-day. Its salient characteristic is a newly aroused interest
and enthusiasm in one country for the political forces that seem
to make stability their watchword in the other. The coalition
has become the hero of the New York <cite>Times</cite> and <cite>Tribune</cite>—the
triumph of the Republican party was hailed almost as a
national victory in the London <cite>Times</cite> and Birmingham <cite>Post</cite>.
Intransigeance in foreign policies finds ready forgiveness in
London; in return, a blind eye is turned to schemes of territorial
aggrandisement at Washington.</p>

<p>If a flaw is to be discerned in what at first sight seems a perfectly
adjusted instrument for international comity, it is that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
this new Anglo-American understanding seems to be founded
on class rather than on national sympathy. Even offhand
some inherent inconsistency would seem to be sensed from the
fact that the appeal of the great republic comes most home, in
the parent country, to the class that is least attached to democratic
forms and the most fearful of change. References to
America arouse no enthusiasm at meetings of the labour element
in England, and it is still felt unwise to expose the Union
Jack to possible humiliation in parades on a large scale in New
York or Chicago. A sympathy that flowers into rhetoric at
commercial banquets or at meetings of the archæologically inclined
may have its roots in the soundest political wisdom.
But to infer from such demonstrations of class solidarity any
national community of thought or aim is both unwarranted and
unsafe. This much is evident, that should a class subversion,
always possible in a country the political fluidity of which is
great, leave the destinies of Great Britain in the hands of the
class that is silent or hostile to-day when the name of America
is mentioned, an entire re-statement of Anglo-American unity
would become necessary, in terms palatable to the average
Englishman.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>This average Englishman is a highly complicated being.
Through the overlay which industrialism has imposed on him,
he has preserved to quite an extraordinary extent the asperities,
the generosities, the occasional eccentricities of the days
when he was a free man in a free land. No melting process
has ever subdued the sharp bright hues of his individuality
into the universal, all-pervading drab that is the result
of blending primary colours. No man who has employed
him to useful purpose has ever succeeded in reducing his personality
to the proportions of a number on a brass tag. The
pirate and rover who looked upon Roman villadom and found
it not good, the archer who brought the steel-clad hierarchy
of France toppling from their blooded horses at Crécy and
Agincourt, the churl who struck off the heads of lawyers in
Westminster Palace yard survive in him.</p>

<p>If I am stressing this kink in the British character it is because
one of its results has been to make the Englishman of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
all men the least impressed by scale, and the one to whom appeals
made on the size of an experiment or the vastness of a
vision will evoke the least response, and especially because I
think I perceive a tendency to approach him in the interests
of Anglo-American unity precisely from the angle that will
awake antagonism where co-operation is sought. The attachment
of the Englishman to little things and to hidden things,
which no one except Chesterton has had the insight to perceive,
or at all events which Chesterton was the first to place in
its full relation to his inconsistencies, explains his strangely
detached attitude to that British Empire of which his country
is the core. Its discovery as an entity calling for a special
quality in thought and action dates no further back than that
strange interlude in history, when the personality of Roosevelt
and the vision of Kipling held the imagination of the world.</p>

<p>This refusal to be impressed by greatness, whether his own
or others’, has its disadvantages, but at least it has one saving
element. It leaves an Englishman quite capable of perceiving
that it is possible for a thing to be grandiose in scale and mean
in quality. It leaves intact his frank and childlike confidence
that the little things of the world confound the strong; his
implicit conviction that David will always floor Goliath, and
that Jack’s is the destined sword to smite off the giant’s head.
The grotesqueness of the Kaiser’s upturned moustaches,
the inadequacy of a mythical “William the Weed” to
achieve results that would count, were his guiding lights
to victory, the touchstones by which he tested in advance the
vast machine that finally cracked and broke under its own
weight. It was the “contemptible” little army of shopmen
and colliers which seized his imagination and held his affection
throughout, not the efficient mechanical naval machine
that fought one great sea battle, which was a revelation of
the risks inherent in its own monstrousness and complexity,
and made its headquarters in Scapa Flow. I recall the comments
heard at the time of Jutland in the artillery camp where
fate had throwm me. They served to confirm a dawning conviction
that the navy, while it still awes and impresses, lost
its hold on the British heart the day wooden walls were exchanged
for iron and steel. It is perhaps the “silent service”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
to-day because its appeal awakes so little response. It has
been specialized and magnified out of the average Englishman’s
power to love it.</p>

<p>In America the contrary seems the case. The American
heart appears to go out to bulk, to scale, and to efficiency. The
American has neither the time nor the temperament to test
and weigh. His affections, even his loyalties, seem to be at
the mercy of aspects that impose and impress. I know no
other country where the word “big” is used so constantly as
a token of affection. Every community has its “Big Tims,”
“Big Bills,” “Big Jacks,” great hearty fellows who gambol
and spout on public occasions with the abandonment of a
school of whales. Gargantuan “Babe Ruth,” mountainous
Jack Dempsey are the idols of its sport-loving crowds.
“Mammoth in character,” the qualification which on the lips
of the late Mr. Morgan Richards stirred laughter throughout
England, is to the American no inconsequential or slipshod
phrase. He does perceive a character and justification in
bigness. It was perhaps to this trait in his mental make-up
that the puzzling shift of allegiance to the beginning
of the great war was due. The scale and completeness of the
German effort laid hold of his imagination to an extent that
only those who spent the first few months of agonizing doubt
in the West and the Middle West can appreciate. Something
that was obscurely akin, something that transcended racial affinities
and antipathies, awoke in him at the steady ordered
flow of the field-grey legions Westward, so adequately pictured
for him by Richard Harding Davis. He is quite merciless to
defeat.</p>

<p>Nothing conceived on such a scale can indulge complexities.
Its ideals must be ample, rugged, and primitive, adequate
to the vast task. Hence the velocity, the thoroughness,
the apparent ruthlessness with which American enterprises are
put through. It is the fashion among a certain school of
thought to call America the country of inhibitions. But there
is little inhibition to be perceived on that side of his temperament,
which the American has chosen to cultivate, leaving all
else to those who find perverse attraction in weed and ruin.
His language—and he is amazingly vocal—is as simple and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
direct as his thought. The appeals and admonitions of his
leaders reverberate from vast and resonant lungs. They are
calculated rather to carry far than to penetrate deeply. They
are statements and re-statements rather than arguments. If
their verbiage often aims at and sometimes seems to attain
the sublime, if the American leader is forever dedicating, consecrating,
inspiring something, the altitude is like the elevation
given a shell in order that it may travel further. The nimble
presentation of antithesis of a Lloyd George, the dagger-play
of sarcasm of an Asquith, are conspicuously absent from the
speeches of American leaders. There is something arrogant
and ominous, like the clenching of a fist before the arm is
raised, in this sonorous presentation of a faith already securely
rooted in the hearts of all its hearers.</p>

<p>This primitiveness and single-mindedness of the American
seem to intensify as his historical origins recede further and
further into the past. It is idle to speculate on what might
have happened had the development of his country remained
normal and homogeneous, as, up to the Civil War, it admittedly
did. It is an even less grateful task to look back on the
literature of the Transcendental period and register all that
American thought seems to have lost since in subtlety and essential
catholicity. What is really important is to realize that
not only the language but the essence of Occidental civilization
has called for simplification, for sacrifice, year by year.
It is hard to see what other choice has lain before the American,
as wave after wave of immigration diluted his homogeneity,
than to put his concepts into terms easily understood
and quickly grasped, with the philological economy of the traveller’s
pocket manual and the categorical precision of the drill
book. If in the very nature of things, this evangel is oftener
pointed with a threat than made palatable with the honey of
reason and sympathy, the task and not the taskmaster is to
blame. On no other country has ever been imposed similar
drudgery on a similar scale. It is idle to talk about the spiritual
contribution of the foreigner when his first duty is to cast
that contribution into the discard. It is futile to appeal to his
traditions where the barrier of language rears itself in a few
years between parents who have never learnt the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>
tongue and children who are unable or ashamed to speak the
old.</p>

<p>But such a régime cannot endure for many years without a
profound influence, not only on those to whom it is prescribed,
but on those who administer it. The most heaven-born
leader of men, put into a receiving depot to which monthly
and fortnightly contingents of bemused recruits arrive, quickly
deteriorates into something like a glorified and commissioned
drill sergeant. The schoolmaster is notoriously a social failure
in circles where intercourse must be held on the level to which
the elevation of his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">estrade</i> has dishabituated him. Exact
values—visions, to use a word that misuse has made hateful—disappear
under a multiplicity of minor tasks. It is one of the
revenges taken by fate that those who must harass and drive
become harassed and sterile in turn.</p>

<p>No one yet, so far as I know, has sought to place this
amazing simplification in its true relation to the aridity of
American life, an aridity so marked that it creates a positive
thirst for softer and milder civilizations, not only in the foreigner
who has tasted of them, but at a certain moment in their
life in almost every one of the native born whose work lies
outside the realm of material production. It is not that in England,
as in every community, entire classes do not exist who seek
material success by the limitation of interests and the retrenchment
of sympathies. But in so doing they sacrifice to a domestic,
not a national God; they follow personal not racial proclivities.
There is no conscious subscription to a national ideal
in their abandonment of æsthetic impulses. Side by side with
them live other men whose apparent contentment with insecure
and unstable lives at once redresses their pride and curtails
their influence. They are conscious of the existence
around them of a whole alien world, the material returns from
which are negligible but in which other men somehow manage
to achieve a fullness of experience and maintain self-respect.
This other world reacts not only on employer but on employed.
For the worker it abates the fervour and stress of his
task, lends meaning and justification to his demand for leisure
in the face of economic demands that threaten or deny. No one
in England has yet dared to erect into an evangel the obvious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
truth that poor men must work. No compulsion sets the
mental attitude a man may choose when faced with his task.
The speeder-up and the efficiency expert is hateful and alien.
“A fair day’s wage for a fair day’s work” may seem a loose
and questionable phrase, but its implications go very deep.
It sets a boundary mark on the frontier between flesh and
spirit by which encroachments are registered as they occur.</p>

<p>In America no such frontier exists. Here the invasion
seems to be complete. The spirit that would disentangle material
from immaterial aims wanders baffled and perplexed
through a maze of loftily conceived phrases and exhortations
each one of which holds the promise of rescue from the drudgery
of visionless life, yet each one of which leads back to an
altar where production is enthroned as God. Manuals and
primers, one had almost written psalters, pour out from the
printing presses in which such words as “inspiration,” “dedication,”
“consecration” urge American youth not to the renunciation
of material aims but to their intensive pursuit.
This naïve and simple creed is quite free of self-consciousness
or hypocrisy. In its occasional abrupt transitions from the
language of prayer to such conscience-searching questions as
“Could you hold down a $100.00 a week job?” or “Would
you hire yourself?” no lapse from the sublime to the ridiculous,
far less to the squalid, is felt. It has the childlike gravity
and reverence of all religions that are held in the heart.</p>

<p>But its God is a jealous God. No faltering in his service,
no divided allegiance is permitted. His rewards are concrete
and his punishments can be overwhelming. For open rebellion,
outlawry; for secret revolt, contempt and misunderstanding
are his inevitable visitations. For this reason those who
escape into heresy not unfrequently lose their integrity and are
gibbeted or pilloried for the edification of the faithful. The
man who will not serve because the service starves and stunts
his soul is all too likely to find himself dependent for company
upon the man who will not serve because his will is too
weak or his habits too dissipated.</p>

<p>That this service is a hard one, its most ardent advocates
make no attempt to conceal. Its very stringency is made the
text of appeals for ever and ever fresh efficiency, intensive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
training, specialization. “The pace they must travel is so
swift,” one advocate of strenuousness warns his disciples,
“competition has become so fierce that brains and vision are
not enough. One must have the <em>punch</em> to put things through.”
The impression grows that the American business man, new
style, is a sombre gladiator, equipped for his struggle by rigorous
physical and mental discipline. The impression is helped
by a host of axioms, plain and pictured, that feature a sort of
new cant of virility. “Red-blooded men,” “Two-fisted men,”
“Men who do things,” “Get-there fellows,” are a few headliners
in this gospel of push and shove.</p>

<p>The service is made still more difficult by its uncertainty,
since no gospel of efficiency can greatly change the proportion
of rewards, though it can make the contest harder and the
marking higher. Year in year out, while competition intensifies
and resources are fenced off, insecurity of employment remains,
an evil tradition from days when opportunity was really boundless
and competition could be escaped by a move of a few score
miles Westward. Continuity in one employment still remains
the exception rather than the rule, and when death or retirement
reveals an instance it is still thought worthy of space in
local journals. “Can you use me?” remains the customary
gambit for the seeker after employment. The contempt of a
settled prospect, of routine work, the conception of business as
something to work <em>up</em> rather than to work <em>at</em> is still latent in
the imagination of atavistic and ambitious young America. Of
late years this restlessness, even though in so worthy a cause
as “getting on,” has been felt as a hindrance to full efficiency,
and the happy idea has been conceived of applying the adventurous
element of competition at home. Territorial or departmental
spheres are allotted within or without the “concern”
to each employé; the results attained by A, B, and C are then
totalled, analyzed, charted, and posted in conspicuous places
where all may see, admire, and take warning. In the majority
of up-to-date houses “suggestions” for the expansion or improvement
of the business are not only welcomed but expected,
and the employé who does not produce them in reasonable bulk
and quality is slated for the “discard.” When inventiveness
tires, “shake-ups” on a scale unknown in England take place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
and new aspirants eager to “make good” step into the shoes of
the old. The business athletes strain and pant toward the
goal. There is no rest for the young man “consecrated” to
merchandising effort. Like the fly in the fable, he must struggle
and swim until the milk around his legs is churned into the
butter of executive position.</p>

<p>The American press, hybrid, highly coloured, and often
written by men of erratic genius who prefer the poor rewards
of news writing to the commercial yoke, conveys but a partial
idea of this absorption of an entire race in a single function.
A far more vivid impression is to be gained from the “house
organs,” and publicity pamphlets which pour from the press
in an unceasing stream and the production of which within
recent years has become a large and lucrative industry. Here
articles and symposia on such themes as “Building Character
into Salesmanship,” “Hidden Forces that bring Sales,” and
“Capitalizing Individuality,” often adorned with half-tones of
tense and joyless faces, recur on every page. No sanctuary
is inviolable, no recess unexplored. The demand of the commercial
God is for the soul, and he will be content with no less.</p>

<p>This demand implies a revised conception of the relation
between employé and employer. The old contract under
which time and effort were hired for so many hours a day at a
stated remuneration, leaving life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness outside those hours a matter of personal predilection,
is now abrogated, or at least sharply questioned. It is recognized,
and with entire logic, that the measure of accomplishment
within working hours will depend largely on the environment
amid which hours of recreation are spent; and that
though detection of inefficiency is a task of keen brains that
seldom fail, this detection, in the nature of things, may not
take place until damage has been done the commercial structure.
This is the real inwardness of a whole new gospel of
“Welfare” and “Uplift,” under whose dispensation employés
are provided with simple and tested specifics for recreation,
with the watchful and benevolent eye of department heads
upon them, in which it is presumed and stated with entire candour
that the physical, moral, and mental efficiency of the
staffs and “salesforce” has become the concern of the organization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
that has allotted them a place in its economy. The
organism works, plays, rests, moves on together.</p>

<p>Nothing is more terrifying, as that master of terror, Edgar
Allan Poe, perceived, than an organism that is at once mean
and colossal. Properties of efficiency and adaptation to one
definite end are bestowed in an eminent degree only on the
lower orders of animal life. With rigid bodies, encasing organs
that are designed for simple, metabolic purposes, armed
with an elaborate mechanism of claws, hinges, borers, valves,
and suckers the lepidoptera are living tools that fly or creep.
Absorbed in one tireless function, with all distractions of love
and war delegated to specialized subspecies, they neither love,
hate, nor rebel. As the scale ascends, efficiency dwindles, until
in the litter and loneliness of the den, lazy domesticity
with dam and cubs, the joy of prey hunt and love hunt, between
the belly pinch of hunger and the sleep of repletion, the
lives of the big carnivora pass in a sheer joy of living for living’s
sake until the gun of the hunter ends the day dream.</p>

<p>It has been left for man—hapless and inventive—to realize
a life that touches both ends of the scale, to feel at his heart
the pull of hive-life and jungle-life in turn. Something of the
ant and something of the tiger lurks in every normal human
creature. If he has immense powers of assertion, his faculty
for abdication seems to be as limitless. It is just this dual
nature in man that makes prophecy as to what “will happen
the world” so difficult and unsafe. But one prophecy may be
ventured on and that is, that in proportion as acquiescence or
revolt seize the imaginations of separated nations will those
nations coalesce or drift apart into antagonism.</p>

<p>If a life spent during the last twenty years between
England and the United States is any title to judge, I
should say that at the present moment the dominant note
in America is acquiescence in, and in England revolt against
the inordinate demands of commercialism. Here, to all appearances,
the surrender for the moment is complete. There
are revolts, but they are sporadic and misguided and their
speedy suppression seems to stir no indignation and to
awaken no thrill of common danger among the body of
workers. Strikes confined to wage issues are treated more indulgently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
but even they are generally strangled at their birth
by injunctions, and a sour or hostile attitude of authority
makes success difficult. In any display of opposition to established
conditions, even when based on the most technical
grounds, authority appears to sense a challenge to larger issues
and to meet them half way with a display of force that
to an Englishman appears strangely over-adequate. It is evident
the ground is being tested. Interpretations of liberty that
date from easier and roomier days are under revision, and
where they are found at variance with a conception of society
as a disciplined and productive force, they are being roughly
retrenched. The prevailing character of the labour mass, at
once heterogeneous and amorphous, makes it a safe and ductile
medium for almost any social experiment. “If you don’t like
it, go back,” is an argument to which no answer has been
found. Native-born labour shares in the universal dis-esteem
and takes refuge from it in aristocratic and doctrinaire federations
whose ineffectiveness is apparent whenever a labour issue
arises. For the rebel who, under these conditions, chooses
to fight on, rougher methods are found. He may become <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">fera
natura</i>. Tarring and feathering, ducking and rubbing with
acid, and deportation from State to State may be his portion.
Under any social condition conformity is the easiest
course. When the prison cell and social pillory are its
alternatives, to resist requires a degree of fanatical courage
and interior moral resources possessed only by a handful of
men in a generation.</p>

<p>To this conception of a disciplined community harnessed to
the purpose of production, thousands of the possessing and
capitalistic classes look wistfully from the other side of the
Atlantic. But there are many obstacles to its realization in
England. The English proletarian is no uprooted orphan, paying
with docile and silent work for the citizenship of his children
and grandchildren. That great going concern, the British
Empire, is his personal work, built on the bones and cemented
with the blood of his forebears. His enfranchisement is as complete
as his disinheritance, and the impoverishment of his country,
evidenced in the stream of gold that pours Westward like
arterial blood, has not reached to his spirit. Even the Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
War, with its revelation to him of how ruthless and comprehensive
the demands of the State on the individual can be,
has only reinforced his sense of being a very deserving person
and has added to the long debt which he is frankly out to
collect. The promises, the appeals to national pride and tradition
with which he had to be appeased while, for the first time
in his history, the yoke of universal service was laid upon his
neck, trip up the feet of his rulers to-day. It is difficult to
tell him to go elsewhere, for he “belongs” in England. Even
suggestions that he should emigrate wholesale to British colonies
in order to relieve the congested labour market are received
with mocking laughter in which a threat lurks. He is,
I am sure, because I know him, looking on with a certain sardonic
relish and enjoyment at the flurries, the perplexities of
his rulers, their displays of force alternated with appeals to
sweet reason, their brave words succeeded by abject denials
and qualifications. He is waiting until the naked economic
question, which he knows well underlies all the rhodomontade
of national greatness and imperial heritage, shall be put to
him. It will be a great and momentous day when the Englishman
is given his choice. A choice it must be. The means
to compulsion are not here.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>To America just now Europeans as a whole must seem a
helpless race, bewildered actors in a vast and tragic blunder.
To thousands of Red Cross workers, Knights of Columbus,
and welfare auxiliaries in devastated districts, the spectacle of
suffering and want must have come home to reinforce impressions
already gained from sights witnessed at Ellis Island or
Long Wharf. None the less, it is an historical misfortune that
the first real contact between the people of the two continents
should have come at a time when the older was bankrupt and
had little to show save the rags and tatters of its civilization.
The reverse of the tenderness to the stricken European abroad
has been a hardening of the heart to the immigrant at home,
and it is difficult for the American, schoolmaster and lawgiver
to so many alien peoples in his own country, to divest himself
of a didactic character in his foreign relations. To many
countries he is “saying it with flour,” and those who accept the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
dole can do little else than swallow the sermon. Even to those
countries who were his allies he does shine forth in a certain
splendour of righteousness. His sacrifice was deliberate—which
is, perhaps, its best excuse for being a little conscious.
It was self-imposed, and fifty thousand of his dead,
wrested from productive enterprises to lie in France, attest
its sincerity. No Englishman, at any rate, believes in his
heart that its material reward, great and inevitable as it is
now seen to be, was the driving force at the time the sacrifice
was accepted. There are a host of reasons, some creditable,
others less so, that make Europe curb its restiveness under
American homilies.</p>

<p>With England the case is different. No one knows just
how hard Britain has been hit, but she is managing to put a
good face on her wounds. No relief organization from the
big sister has landed its khaki-clad apostles of hygiene and
its grey-cloaked sisters of mercy on English shores. The façade
is intact, the old masters in possession. With a few shifts
and changes in political labelling that are a matter of domestic
concern, those who steered the big concern into the bankruptcy
of war are still entrusted with its extrication. No great
subversion stands as a witness of a change of national faith.
The destinies, the foreign relations, the aspects that attract
or antagonize remain in the hands of men who secured a fresh
lease of power by a clever political trick. The skeleton at the
feast of racial reunion is not Ireland, nor Mesopotamia, nor
Yap, nor the control of the seas. It is the emergence into
political power, sooner or later, but inevitably from the very
nature of British political institutions, of the British proletariat.</p>

<p>Frankly I do not see, when this moment arrives, who is
going to put the gospel of American civilization into terms that
will be, I shall not say acceptable, but even significant, to the
emancipated British worker. Ruling classes in the older
country who rely on a steadying force from across the Atlantic
in possible political upheavals must have strange misgivings
when they take account of their own stewardship. It will be
an ungrateful task to preach the doctrine of salvation through
work to a people that has tried it out so logically and completely
that the century which has seen the commercial supremacy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
of their country has witnessed the progressive impoverishment
and proletarization of its people. Homilies on
discipline will sound strangely in the ears of those who, while
America was enjoying her brief carnival of spacious and fruitful
endeavour in a virgin land, went under an industrial yoke
that has galled their necks and stunted their physical growth.
Appeals to pride of race will have little meaning coming from
a stock that has ceased through self-indulgence or economic
upward pressure to resist ethnologically and whose characteristics
are disappearing in the general amalgam.</p>

<p>The salient fact that stands out from all history is that inordinateness
of any sort has never failed to act upon the English
character as a challenge. His successes, whatever his libellists
may seek to believe, have seldom been against the small
or weak. It has been his destiny, in one recurrent crisis after
another, to find himself face to face with some claimant to
world power, some “cock of the walk.” To use a homely
phrase, it has always been “up to him.” And the vision of
his adversary which has nerved his arm has always been an
excess in some quality easily understandable by the average
man. Bigotry is not the monopoly of the Spaniard, nor commercial
greed of the Hollander, nor vanity of the Frenchman,
nor pomposity of the German. It would be an easy task to
convict the Englishman of some share in each vice. Nevertheless
history in the main has justified his instinct for proportion,
his dislike for “slopping over.” In something far beyond
the accepted phrase, the English struggle has been a
struggle for the “balance of power.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> application of the term “shirt-sleeve” to American
diplomacy is perhaps the most concise expression of the
conception we have formed in Europe of life in the United
States. We imagine that it is only necessary to cross the Atlantic
Ocean to find a people young and vigorous in its emancipation
from ancient forms and obsolete ceremonies. The average
visitor returns, after a brief tour through the more urbane
centres of European imitation, and tries to startle us with a
narrative in which a few picturesque crudities are supposed to
indicate the democratic ease of American civilization. His
mind is filled with an incoherent jumble of skyscrapers, express
elevators, ice water, chewing-gum, and elevated railroads,
so that his inevitable contribution to the literature relating to
America becomes the mere chronicle of a tourist’s experiences.
Every deviation from European practice is emphasized, and in
proportion to the writer’s consequent personal discomfort, he
will conjure up a hideous picture of uncouthness, whose effect
is to confirm us in our estimate of American progress ...
or barbarism, as the case may be. If the critical stranger
happens to be a well-known poet or dramatist, he will probably
succeed in passing lightly over those minor inconveniences,
which the generosity of wealthy admirers has prevented
him from experiencing at first hand.</p>

<p>The consequence is that there is no subject more hopelessly
involved in a cloud of voluminous complaint and banal laudation
than American life as seen by the foreigner. Neither the
enthusiasts nor the fault-finders have contributed much of any
assistance either to Europeans or to the Americans themselves.
The former accept America at its own valuation, the latter
complain of precisely those things upon which the average citizen
prides himself. It is not easy to decide which class of
critics has helped most effectively to perpetuate the legend of
American freedom; the minor commentators who hold democracy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
to be the cause of every offence, or the higher critics, like
Viscount Bryce, who, finding no American commonwealth, proceeded
to invent one. The objectors are dismissed as witnesses
to the incapacity of the servile European to appreciate
true liberty and equality; the well-disposed are gratefully received
as evangelists of a gospel to which Americans subscribe
without excessive introspection. There is something touching
in the gratitude felt towards the author of “The American
Commonwealth.” Who would have believed that a foreigner,
and a Britisher at that, could make a monument of such imposing
brick with the straws of political oratory in the United
States?</p>

<p>On one point all observers have involuntarily agreed.
Whether with approval or disapproval, they have depicted for
us a society which presents such marked divergencies from
our own manners and customs that there is not one of us but
comes to America believing that his best or worst hopes will
be confirmed. It is, therefore, somewhat disconcerting to
confess that neither presentment has been realized. To have
passed from Continental Europe to New York, via London,
is to deprive oneself of that social and intellectual shock which
is responsible for the uniformly profound impression which
transatlantic conditions make upon the European mind. So
many continentals enjoy in the United States their first direct
contact with Anglo-Saxon institutions and modes of thought
that the revelation cannot fail to stimulate them. Their writings
frequently testify to a naïve ignorance of the prior existence
in England of what excites their dismay or admiration in
America. If it be asked why, then, have Englishmen similarly
reacted to the same stimuli, if acquaintance with England
blunts the fine edge of perception, the reply must be: the
quality of their emotion is different. The impression made
upon a mind formed by purely Latin traditions necessarily
differs from that received by a mind previously subjected to
Anglo-Saxon influences. Consequently, the student of American
life who has neither the motive of what might be called
family jealousy, in the Englishman, nor the mentality, wholly
innocent of alien culture, of the Latin, would seem well
equipped to view the subject from another angle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span></p>

<p>To the good European the most striking characteristic of
the United States is a widespread intellectual anæmia. So far
from exhibiting those traits of freedom and progress which
harrow the souls of sensitive aristocrats in Europe, the American
people alarm the outsider in search of stimulating ideas
by their devotion to conventions and formulæ. As soon as one
has learnt to discount those lesser manifestations of independence,
whose perilous proximity to discourtesy gives them an
exaggerated importance in the eyes of superficial critics, the
conventionality of the American becomes increasingly evident.
So many foreigners have been misled—mainly because of an
apparent rudeness—by this show of equality, this ungraciousness
in matters of service, that one hesitates at first to dismiss
the unconventional American as a myth closely related
to that of the “immoral Frenchman.” It is only when prolonged
association has revealed the timid respectability beneath
this veneer of informality that it becomes possible to understand
the true position of America. From questioning individuals
one proceeds to an examination of the public utterances
of prominent men, and the transition from the press to literature
is easily made. At length comes the discovery that mentally
the United States is a generation or two behind Western
Europe. The rude and vigorous young democracy, cited by
its admirers in extenuation of æsthetic sins of omission and
commission, suddenly stands forth attired in the garment of
ideas which clothed early Victorian England.</p>

<p>This condition is largely due to the absence of an educated
class accustomed to leisure. To the American work for work’s
sake has a dignity unknown in Europe, where it is rare to find
anybody working for mere wages if he has any means of independent
subsistence, however small. In America the contrary
is the case, and people who could afford to cultivate their own
personalities prefer to waste their energies upon some definite
business. Almost all the best that has come out of Europe
has been developed in that peculiar class which sacrificed
money-making for the privilege of leisure and relative independence.
The only corresponding class in the United States
is that of the college professors, who are an omnipresent menace
to the free interplay of ideas. Terrorized by economic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
fears and intellectual inhibitions, they have no independence.
They are despised by the plain people because of their failure
to make money; and to them are relegated all matters which
are considered of slight moment, namely, learning and the arts.
In these fields the pedants rule unchallenged, save when some
irate railroad presidents discover in their teachings the heresy
of radicalism. Æsthetics is a science as incomprehensible to
them as beauty, and they prefer to substitute the more homely
Christian ethics. Moral preoccupations are their sole test of
excellence. The views of these gentlemen and their favourite
pupils fill the bookshelves and the news-stands.</p>

<p>The professorial guardians of Colonial precedents and traditions
determine what the intellectual life of America shall be.
Hence the cult of anæmia. Instead of writing out of themselves
and their own lives, they aspire to nothing greater than
to be classed as English. They are obsessed by the standards
imposed from without, and their possible achievement is
thwarted. While they are still shaking their heads over Poe,
and trying to decide whether Whitman is respectable, a national
literature is growing up without the guidance and help
which it should expect from them. At the same time, as the
official pundits have the ear of Europe, and particularly of
England, American culture is known only as they reflect it.
It is natural, therefore, that the European attitude should be
as contemptuous as it so often is.</p>

<p>When the reviews publish some ignorant and patronizing
dissertation on the American novel or American poetry, by an
English writer, they are pained by the evident lack of appreciation.
The ladies and gentlemen whose works are respectfully
discussed by the professors, and warmly recommended by
the reviewers, do not seem to receive the consideration due to
them for their unflinching adherence to the noblest standards
of academic criticism. When these torch-bearers of the purest
Colonial tradition are submitted to the judgment of their
“big” cousins in England, there is a noticeable condescension
in those foreigners. But why should they profess to admire
as the brightest stars in the American firmament what are,
after all, the phosphorescent gleams of literary ghosts? Is
it any wonder that the majority of Britishers can continue in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
the comfortable belief that there is practically no American
literature worthy of serious attention?</p>

<p>The academic labours of American professors of literature
are an easy and constant butt for English critics. Yet, they
rarely think of questioning the presentation of literary America
for which these gentlemen are so largely responsible. When
have the Stuart Shermans and Paul Elmer Mores (and their
diminutives) recognized the existence of a living American
writer of genius, originality, or distinction? The only justification
for their existences is their alleged capacity to estimate
literary values. If they cannot do so, it is hardly surprising
that their English patrons, who imagine that they are
representative men, do not often penetrate the veil of Colonialism.
Whatever their outward professions, the majority of
Englishmen regard all other English-speaking countries as
Colonies. Since they are stubborn enough when faced with
undeniable proof of the contrary, as in Ireland, it is unlikely
they will persuade themselves unaided that they are mistaken.
When will American criticism have the courage to base the
claims of contemporary literature on those works which are
essentially and unmistakably American?</p>

<p>The mandarins, of course, have stood for reaction in all
countries, and there is no intention here to acquit the European
of the species. So many of his worst outrages are matters
of history that it would be futile to pretend that he is untrue
to type. Nevertheless, his position in Europe is measurably
more human than in this country, owing to the greater freedom
of intellectual intercourse. In America the mandarin is firmly
established on a pedestal which rests upon the vast unculture
of an immense immigrant population, enjoying for the first
time the benefits of sufficient food and heat. He is obviously
secure in his conviction that those qualified to challenge him—except
perhaps some isolated individual—are not likely to
do so, being of the same convention as himself. He belongs
to the most perfect trade-union, one which has a practical monopoly
of its labour. His European colleagues, on the contrary,
live in constant dread of traitors from their ranks, or
worse still, the advance of an opposing force manned with
brains of no inferior calibre. France, for example, can boast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
of a remarkable roll of names which never adorned the councils
of pedantry, or not until they had imposed a new tradition.
The two finest minds of modern French literature, Anatole
France and Rémy de Gourmont, are illustrations of this
fact. France has never allowed his academic honours to
restrict the daring play of his ideas; Gourmont died in the
admiration of all cultivated men, although his life was a prolonged
protest against the orthodox, who never succeeded in
taming him.</p>

<p>What America requires is an unofficial <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">intelligentsia</i> as
strong and as articulate as the political and literary pundits,
whose purely negative attitude first exasperates, and finally
sterilizes, every impulse towards originality. Only when a survey
is made of the leading figures in the various departments
of American life is it possible fully to realize the weight of
inertia which presses upon the intellect of the country. While
the spirit of enterprise and progress is stimulated and encouraged
in all that relates to material advancement, the artistic
and reasoning faculties are deadened. Scientific study, when
directed to obviously practical ends, is the only form of mental
effort which can count upon recognition and reward. It is not
without its significance that the Johns Hopkins Medical School
is the one learned institution in America whose fame is world-wide
amongst those who appreciate original research, otherwise
the names of few universities are mentioned outside academic
circles. Even in the field of orthodox literary culture
the mandarins have, in the main, failed to do anything positive.
They have preferred to bury their talent in anæmic
commentary. The reputed intellectuals are still living on a
tradition bequeathed by the attenuated transcendentalism of
the Bostonian era.</p>

<p>That tradition was, after all, but a refinement of the notorious
Puritanism of New England. Having lost whatever
semblance of dignity the Emersons and Thoreaus conferred
upon it, its subsequent manifestations have been a decadent
reversion to aboriginal barbarism. This retrograde movement,
so far as it affects social life, is noticeable in the ever-increasing
number of crusades and taboos, the constant probing
of moral and industrial conditions, unrelated to any well-considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
desire for improvement, or intelligent conception
of progress. The orgies of prohibition and suppression are
unbelievable to the civilized European, who has no experience
of a community in which everything from alcohol to Sunday
tennis has attracted the attention of the “virtuosi of vice”—to
quote the phrase of a discerning critic. Innumerable commissions,
committees, and boards of enquiry supplement the
muck-raking of yellow journalism, and encourage espionage in
social reformers. But what has the country to show for this?
Probably the greatest number of bungled, unsolved, and misunderstood
problems of all industrial nations of the same
rank.</p>

<p>These debauches of virtue, however, are the direct outcome
of the mental conditions fostered by those who are in a position
to mould public opinion. The crowd which tolerates,
or participates in, the Puritanical frenzy is merely reflecting
the current political and social doctrine of the time. Occasionally
the newspapers will hold a symposium, or the reviews
will invite the aid of some foreign critic, to ascertain the reasons
for the prevailing puerility of American fiction. Invariably
it is urged, and rightly, that the novel is written by
women for women. Where almost all articles of luxury are
produced for female consumption, and the arts are deemed
unessential to progress, the latter are naturally classed with
uneconomic production destined to amuse the idle. They are
left to the women, as the men explain, who have not yet understood
the true dignity of leisure. They are abandoned,
in other words, to the most unreal section of the community,
to those centres of culture, the drama leagues and literary
clubs, composed of male and female spinsters. Needless to
say, any phrase or idea likely to have disturbed a mid-Victorian
vicarage will be ruled out as unseemly.</p>

<p>The malady of intellectual anæmia is not restricted to any
one department of American life. In politics, as in art and
literature, there is a dread of reality. The emasculation of
thought in general is such as to render colourless the ideas
commonly brought to the attention of the public. Perhaps the
most palpable example of this penchant for platitude is the
substantial literature of a pseudo-philosophic character which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
encumbers the book-stores, and is read by thousands of right-thinking
citizens. Namby-pamby works, it is true, exist to
some extent in all Protestant countries, but their number,
prevalence, and cost in America are evidence of the demand
they must meet. It is not for nothing that the books of
thoughtful writers are crowded from shelves amply stocked
with the meditations of an Orison Swett Marden, a Henry van
Dyke, or a Hamilton Wright Mabie—to mention at random
some typical authors.</p>

<p>These moral soothsayers successfully compete with moving-picture
actors, and novelists whose claim to distinction is their
ability to write the best-seller of the season. If they addressed
themselves only to the conventicles, the phenomenon would
have less significance, but the conventicles have their own
minor prophets. The conclusion, therefore, suggests itself,
that these must be the leaders and moulders of American
thought. The suspicion is confirmed when men of the same
stamp, sometimes, indeed, the actual authors of this evangelical
literature, are found holding the most important public
offices. To have written a methodist-tract would appear to be
an unfailing recommendation for promotion. It is rare to
find the possessor of such a mentality relegated to the obscurity
he deserves.</p>

<p>A wish to forestall the accusation of exaggeration or inaccuracy
imposes the painful obligation of citing specific instances
of the tendency described. Who are the leading
public men of this country, and what have they written? Besides
the classic volumes of Thiers and Guizot must we set
such amiable puerilities as “The New Freedom,” “On Being
Human,” and “When a Man Comes to Himself.” Even the
essays of Raymond Poincaré do not sound the depths indicated
by the mere titles of these presidential works. But the author
of “The State,” for all his antiquated theories of government,
writes measurably above the level of that diplomatist whose
copious bibliography includes numerous variations upon such
themes as “The Gospel for a World of Sin,” “The First
Christmas Tree,” and “The Blue Flower.” A search through
the underworld of parish magazines in England, France, and
Germany would probably reveal something to be classed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span>
the works of Dr. Lyman Abbott, but the authors would not
be entrusted with the editorship of a leading weekly review.
As for the writings of his associate, the existence of his book
on Shakespeare is a testimony to Anglo-Saxon indifference to
the supreme genius of the race.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to dwell upon the literary labours of
William Jennings Bryan, ex-Secretary of State, except to wonder
that they did not alone suffice to disqualify him for such
an office. They belong to the same category as those volumes
of popular American philosophy whose titles are: “Character
the Grandest Thing in the World,” “Cheerfulness as a Life
Power,” and “The Miracle of Right Thought.” If those
quoted are to be laid to the charge of Mr. Orison Swett Marden,
every department of American life contains prominent men
who might say: There, but for the grace of God, speak I. The
sanctimonious breath of the uplifter tarnishes the currency
of ideas in almost every circle of society. Irrespective of
party, Republicans, Democrats, and Socialists help to build up
this monument of platitude which may one day mark the resting
place of the American brain. Books, reviews, magazines,
and newspapers are largely conceived in the evangelical spirit.
The average contributor, when not a foreigner, suggests a
Sunday-school superintendent who has (perhaps) missed his
vocation. Where the subject excludes the pedantry of the
professors, the tone is intensely moral, and the more it is so
the surer one may be that the writer is a colonel, a rear-admiral,
or a civil officer of the State or Federal government.
Imagination refuses to conceive these functionaries as fulfilling
their duties efficiently in any service, other than that of the
Salvation Army or a revivalist campaign.</p>

<p>The stage of culture which these phenomena presuppose cannot
but be hostile to artistic development in such as escape
contamination. It has already been postulated that the just
claims of ethics and æsthetics are hopelessly confounded in
America, to the evident detriment of art in all its branches.
To the poor quality of the current political and social philosophy
corresponds an equally mediocre body of literary
criticism. A recent historian of American literature accords
a high place amongst contemporary critics, to the author of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span>
“Shelburne Essays,” and other works. These volumes are
dignified as “our nearest approach to those ‘Causeries du
Lundi’ of an earlier age,” and may well be taken as representative.
Typical of the cold inhumanity which a certain
type of “cultured person” deems essential is the circumstance
related, by Mr. Paul Elmer More himself, in explanation of
the genesis of these essays. “In a secluded spot,” he writes,
“in the peaceful valley of the Androscoggin I took upon myself
to live two years as a hermit,” and “Shelburne Essays”
was the fruit of his solitary mediations. The historian is
mightily impressed by this evidence of superiority. “In another
and far more unusual way he qualified himself for his
high office of critic,” says Professor Pattee, “he immured himself
for two years in solitude.”... “The period gave him
time to read leisurely, thoughtfully, with no nervous subconsciousness
that the product of that reading was to be marketable.”</p>

<p>What a revelation of combined timidity and intellectual
snobbishness there is in this attitude so fatuously endorsed
by a writer for the schools! We can imagine what the effect
of such a pose must be upon the minds of the students whom
the professor would constrain to respect. Only a young prig
could pretend to be favourably impressed by this pseudo-Thoreau
in the literary backwoods. The impulse of most
healthy young men would be to turn in contempt from an art
so unnatural as this conception of criticism implies. How are
they to know that the Taines, Sainte-Beuves, Brunetières, and
Arnolds of the world are not produced by expedients so primitive
as to suggest the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mise en scène</i> of some latter-day Messiah,
a Dowie, or a Mrs. Baker Eddy? The heralds of new theologies
may find the paraphernalia of asceticism and aloofness a
useful part of their stock in trade—neither is associated with
the great criticism of literature. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">causeries</i> of Sainte-Beuve
were not written in an ivory tower, yet they show no traces
of that “nervous subconsciousness” which our professor finds
inseparable from reading that is “marketable.”</p>

<p>The suspicion of insincerity in this craving for the wilderness
will be strengthened by reference to the first of Mr.
More’s volumes. Whatever may have been the case of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span>
successors, this work was certainly the product of his retirement.
What, then, are the subjects of such a delicate nature
that they could not be discussed within the sound of “the
noisy jargon of the market-place”? Of the eleven essays,
only four deal with writers whose proximity to the critic’s own
age might justify a retreat, in order that they be judged impartially,
and without reference to popular enthusiasm and the
prevalent fashion of the moment. The seven most substantial
studies in the book are devoted to flogging horses so dead that
no fear of their kicking existed. “A Hermit’s Notes on Thoreau,”
“The Solitude of Nathaniel Hawthorne,” “The Origins
of Hawthorne and Poe,” “The Influence of Emerson,” “The
Spirit of Carlyle”—these are a few of the startling topics
which Mr. More could discuss only with fasting and prayer!
Any European schoolmaster could have written these essays in
the leisure moments of his Sunday afternoons or Easter vacation.</p>

<p>No more remarkable profundity or originality will be found
in the critic’s essays in contemporary literature. His strictures
upon Lady Gregory’s versions of the Irish epic, and his comments
upon the Celtic Renaissance in general are the commonplaces
of all hostile English criticism. “The shimmering
hues of decadence rather than the strong colours of life” is
the phrase in which he attempts to estimate the poetry of the
Literary Revival in Ireland. In fact, for all his isolation Mr.
More was obsessed by the critical cant of the hour, as witness
his readiness to apply the term “decadent” to all and sundry.
The work of Arthur Symons is illuminated by this appellation,
as is also that of W. B. Yeats. The jargon of the literary
market-place, to vary Mr. More’s own <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cliché</i>, is all that he
seems to have found in that “peaceful valley of the Androscoggin.”
Even poor Tolstoy is branded as “a decadent with
the humanitarian superimposed,” an application of the word
which renders its previous employment meaningless. As a
crowning example of incomprehension may be cited Mr. More’s
opinion that the English poet, Lionel Johnson, is “the one great
... and genuinely significant poet of the present Gaelic movement.”
In the circumstances, it is not surprising that he
should pronounce Irishmen incapable of exploiting adequately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>
the themes of Celtic literature. For this task he considers
the Saxon genius more qualified.</p>

<p>With these examples before us it is unnecessary to examine
the remaining volumes of “Shelburne Essays.” Having
started with a distorted conception of the critical office, the
author naturally contributed nothing helpful to the literature
of American criticism. His laborious platitudes do not help us
to a better appreciation of the dead, his dogmatic hostility nullifies
his judgments upon the living. Not once has he a word
of discerning censure or encouragement for any rising talent.
Like most of his colleagues, Mr. More prefers to exercise his
faculties at the expense of reputations already established, save
when he condescends to repeat the commonplaces of complaint
against certain of the better known modern writers. He is
so busy with Mrs. Gaskell, Charles Lamb, Milton, Plato, and
Dickens that he can find time to mention only some fifteen
Americans, not one of them living.</p>

<p>Such is the critic whom Professor Pattee salutes as “consistent”
and “courageous,” having “standards of criticism”
which make him comparable to Sainte-Beuve. As editor of
“the leading critical review of America,” we are assured that
Mr. More had “a dominating clientèle and a leader’s authority.”
Alas! There can be no doubt as to this, though it is
very doubtful if the fact can be regarded as “one of the most
promising signs for that new literary era which already is overdue.”
That era will long continue overdue while criticism
remains absorbed in the past, aloof from life and implacably
hostile to every manifestation of originality. If the new literary
generation were merely ignored its lot would be comparatively
happy. But the mandarins come down periodically
from their Olympic communings with George Eliot and Socrates,
to fill the reviews with verbose denunciations of whatever
is being written independently of their idols. The oracles
having spoken, the newcomers are left with an additional
obstacle in the way of their reaching the indifferent ear of the
crowd. The crowd wallows in each season’s literary novelties,
satisfied that whatever is well advertised is good. Rather than
face the subjects endorsed by the frigid enthusiasm of Mr. Paul
Elmer More or Stuart Sherman, Mr. W. C. Brownell and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span>
Professor Brander Matthews, it takes refuge in fields where
the writ of pedantry does not run. Meanwhile, the task of
welcoming new talent is left to amiable journalists, whose
casual recommendations, usually without any background of
critical experience, are accepted as the judgments of competent
experts. The “colyumist” has to perform the true function
of the critic.</p>

<p>Although anæmia is the dominant characteristic of intellectual
life in the United States, the reaction against that condition
is none the less worthy of notice. When we remember
that the fervour of righteousness is the very breath of current
philosophy, we are also reminded that crudeness, sensationalism,
and novelty are commonly held by Europeans to be the
quintessence of America. It might be replied, in answer to
this objection, that Hearst newspapers, and the vaudeville theology
of Billy Sunday, are the only alternatives to the prim
conventionality of authoritative journalism, and the sanctimoniousness
of popular leaders. The man in the street obtains the
illusion of strenuous cerebral activity when he contrasts the
homely qualities of those prophets of democracy with the
spinster-like propriety and beatific purity of prominent publicists
and statesmen. He likes to hear his master’s voice,
it is true, but he likes even more to hear his own, especially
where his personal interests are at issue. The æsthetic <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">obiter
dicta</i> of the professors, like the language of diplomacy, are
concerned with questions sufficiently remote to make sonority
an acceptable substitute for thought.</p>

<p>In the realm of ideas, nevertheless, there is a more or less
articulate expression of reaction, mainly concentrated in the
larger cities of the East. There the professional supermen and
their female counterparts have come together by tacit agreement,
and have attempted to shake off the incubus of respectability.
The extremists impress one as being overpowered by
a sense of their own sinful identity. In a wild burst of hysterical
revolt they are plunged into a debauch of ideas from
which they are emerging in a very shaken and parlous condition.
For the most part their adventures, mental and otherwise,
have been in the domain of sex, with a resultant flooding
of the “radical” market by varied tomes upon the subject.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>
What the bookstores naïvely catalogue as the literature of
advanced thought is a truly wonderful <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salade russe</i>, in which
Krafft-Ebbing and Forel compete with Freud and Eugene
Debs. Karl Marx, and Signora Montessori, Professor Scott
Nearing, and Havelock Ellis engage the same attention as the
neo-Malthusian pamphleteers, and the young ladies whose novels
tell of what Flaubert called “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">les souillures du mariage et
les platitudes de l’adultère</i>.”</p>

<p>The natural morbidity of the Puritan mind is exasperated
in advanced circles, whose interest is nothing if not catholic.
Let Brieux discourse of venereal disease, or Strindberg expound
his tragedies of prurience, their success is assured
amongst those who would believe them geniuses, rather than
risk the ignominy of agreement with the champions of orthodoxy.
So long as our European pornographers are serious
and inartistic, they need have no fear of America. Unbalanced
by prolonged contemplation of the tedious virtues of
New England, a generation has arisen whose great illusion
is that the transvaluation of all values may be effected by
promiscuity. Lest they should ever incur the suspicion of
conservatism the emancipated have a permanent welcome for
everything that is strange or new. The blush on the cheek of
the vice-crusader is their criterion of excellence.</p>

<p>By an irony of fate, however, they are condemned to the
disheartening spectacle of their moral bogies being received
into a society but one removed from the Olympians themselves.
In recent years it has been the practice of the latter to accept
certain reputations, when they have passed through the sieve
of the literary clubs and drama leagues. In fact, candidates
for academic immortality frequently serve on the board of
these literary filtration plants. While the mandarins execute
their ritual in the cult of Longfellow and Bryant, and excommunicate
heretical moderns, their servitors are engaged upon
an ingenious task. They discover the more innocuous subjects
of “radical” enthusiasm, deprive them of whatever sting of
originality their work possessed, and then submit the result
discreetly to the official pundits. When these judges have
satisfied themselves as to the sterility of the innovations, their
imprimatur is granted, and another mediocrity is canonized.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span>
Ibsen is saluted because of his “message,” and “Anna
Karenina” becomes a masterpiece, because Tolstoy was a
Christian. While remarkable talents at home are ignored or
vilified, the fifth-rate European is in the process of literary
naturalization. Mr. Masefield receives the benediction of Paul
Elmer More, who in the same breath tries to convince us that
he is qualified to pronounce “The Spoon River Anthology” a
bad joke.</p>

<p>Nothing more clearly demonstrates the futility and disrepute
of criticism in this country than the constant surrenders to
the prestige of the foreigner. A cheap fashion in European
literature has only to be thrust with sufficient publicity upon
the women’s literary clubs, and parish meeting-houses, to ensnare
the uneasy wearers of the academic crown. Give them
time and they will be found praising a translated French poet
for precisely those qualities which offend them in the protégés
of Miss Harriet Monroe. The young Englishman, Rupert
Brooke, might have contributed to “Poetry” for ten years
without securing any more recognition than did the American,
Robert Frost. But now both reputations, made in England,
are widely accepted, and the inevitable professor is found to
tread respectfully where Henry James rushed in. Compare
the critical essays which James wrote during a period of thirty
years with the stereotyped Bostonian theses of the men he
left behind him. Yet nobody will accuse James of a disregard
for tradition.</p>

<p>The American word “standpatter” is curiously precise as
a designation of the species. The conservative critic in
Europe, Brunetière, for example, is never so purely negative as
his counterpart on this side of the Atlantic. When Brunetière
adversely criticized the Symbolist movement in French poetry
he did so intelligently, not in that laboriously facetious fashion
which is affected by the Stuart Shermans and W. H. Boyntons
when they are moved to discuss <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">les jeunes</i>. Brunetière, in a
word, was a man of education and culture, capable of defending
rationally his own theories, without suggesting that the
unfamiliar was necessarily bad. He condemned the excesses
of the new school, not the school itself. If he had been in
America, he would have denied the Symbolists even the right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>
to exist. Edward Dowden might also be cited as a similar
example, in English literature, of enlightened conservatism.
Dowden was partly responsible for bringing Whitman to the
favourable notice of the English public, and his work stands
as a proof that respect for the classics does not involve hostility
to the moderns. Just as he was able to write a masterpiece
of Shakespearean criticism without retiring into hermitage,
so he was qualified to appreciate original genius when
it presented itself. He was not paralyzed, in short, by the
weight of his literary traditions and conventions.</p>

<p>A thousand and one reasons have been advanced to explain
the absence of a genuine American literature, and all of them
are probably true. The country is comparatively young, and
its energies have been, are still, directed chiefly towards the
exploitation of material resources and the conquest of natural
difficulties. Racially the nation is in an embryonic stage, and
until some homogeneity is attained the creation of a native
tradition must be slow. Moreover, the conflict of diverse races
implies, in a broad sense, the clash of two or more civilizations,
one of which must impose its culture if any organized
progress is to be made. The language of the Hyphenated
States is English, but to what extent will the nation in being
evolve in accordance with this linguistic impulse? Will it be
Anglo-Saxon, Teutonic, Latin, or Slav? These are a few of
the problems which have a direct bearing upon the intellectual
development of the country. They must be solved before
America can give her imprint to the arts. They cannot
be solved by the assumption that the Anglo-Saxon hyphen is
alone authentic. The permanent hypothesis of Colonialism
must be abandoned, if “Americanization” is ever to be more
than the silliest political cant. Puritanism must be confined
to the conventicles, to its natural habitat. It must not be
allowed to masquerade as art, philosophy, and statesmanship.
The evangelical tyranny exists elsewhere, but only in America
has it invaded every branch of the national life. In the more
impatient and realistic generation which has emerged from the
world war this monstrous extension of prohibitions is arousing
a violent reaction. It is rare now to find a young American
who does not cry out against American civilization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span></p>

<p>To the disinterested European, this spectacle is an affecting
illustration of what may be called the enchantment of distance.
Evidently these disconsolate citizens imagine that there is a
way of escape from the Presbyterian wilderness, an oasis in
the desert of one hundred per cent. Americanism, where every
prospect pleases and man is only relatively vile. One listens
to the <em>intelligentsia</em>, rendered more than usually loquacious by
generous potations of unconstitutional Scotch whiskey, cursing
the subtle blow to the arts administered by the Volstead denial
of the necessary ambrosia. Advanced thinkers revelling in
the delights of a well-organized polygamy, have taken me aside
to explain how the prophets of Methodism have laid waste
this fair land. I have read desperate appeals to all young
men of spirit to shake off the yoke of evangelistic philistinism
by expatriation to more urbane centres of culture.</p>

<p>These are brave words, coming as they do, for the most part,
from those who are in no wise incommoded by the ukases of
the gospel-tent tyrants, and who have taken appropriate measures
to defeat the Eighteenth Amendment. Back of all their
plaints is the superstition that Europe is free from the blight
which makes America intolerable in their eyes. They do not
know that the war has almost destroyed the Europe of a
civilized man’s affections. Socially, politically, and intellectually
that distracted continent is rapidly expiring in the arms
of profiteers and class-conscious proletarians, who have decided
between them to leave not a blade of culture upstanding. The
leisured class, which was rarely the wealthiest, is being ground
out of existence by the plutocracy and the proletariat. That
was the class which made the old Europe possible, yet there
are Americans who go on talking as if its extinction did not
knock the bottom out of their utopia. Most of these disgruntled
Americans are radicals, who strive to forward the
designs of the plain people and their advocates.</p>

<p>Yet, every European knows that if prohibition is making
the headway it surely is, the chief reason must be sought in the
growth of radicalism. From Bernard Shaw to Trotsky, our
revolutionaries are “dry.” Their avowed ideal is a state of society
in which the allurements of love are reduced to a eugenic
operation, the mellowing influences of liquor are abolished,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
and compulsory labour on the Taylor efficiency plan of scientific
management is substituted. In fine, by the benign workings
of democratic progress Europe is moving steadily toward
the state of affairs attributed here by disillusioned intellectuals
to the sinister machinations of Wall Street and the evangelists.</p>

<p>No doubt America was a purer and happier place in 1620
than in 1920. No Sumner was needed to keep the eyes of the
settlers from the dimpled knees of Ziegfeld’s beauties, and the
platitudes of the Wilsonian epoch were the brightest flowers of
wisdom in 1776. Alas! that it should be so, and in every
country of our Western World. If the Magna Charta were
to be offered for signature in London now, some nasty Bolshevik
would be sure to prove that the document was drawn
up in a private conclave of the international financiers. If
Lincoln were to make his Gettysburg speech to-day the world
would snicker irreverently, and a dreadfully superior person,
with a Cambridge accent (like John Maynard Keynes, C.B.),
would publish the “Economic Consequences of the Civil War,”
full of sardonic gibes at the innocent evangelism of Springfield.
As for the Declaration of Independence—well, during
“the late unpleasantness” we saw what happened to such un-American
sedition-mongers. In fine, things are not what they
used to be; we pine for what is not, and so forth. Of this only
we may be sure, that America corresponds neither more nor
less than any other country to the dreams of its ancestors.</p>

<p>Indeed, to be more affirmative in this plea for America, it is
probable that this country has followed more closely the intentions
of its founders than the critics will admit. Unlike most
European nations, the Americans have preserved, with an almost
incomprehensible reverence, the constitution laid down
to meet conditions entirely unlike those of the 20th century.
Ancestor worship is the cardinal virtue of America and surpasses
that of China and Japan, where revolutionary changes
have been made in the whole social and political structure.
America was created as a political democracy for the benefit
of staunch individualists, and both these ends have been
achieved to perfection. Everything against which the super-sensitive
revolt has come about <i xml:lang="nl" lang="nl">planmaessig</i>, and existed in the
germ from the day when the Pilgrim Fathers first brought the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span>
blessings of Anglo-Saxon civilization to the shores of Cape
Cod.</p>

<p>In the South alone were traces of a <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Weltanschauung</i> which
might have given an impulse in another direction, but the
South went under, in obedience to the rules of democratic Darwinism.
Once the dissatisfied American can bring himself to
look the facts of his own history and of contemporary Europe
in the face, he may be forced to relent. He will grant, at
least, that it is useless to cherish the notion that the ills the
American mind is heir to are spared to other peoples. He may
even come to recognize the positive virtues of this country,
where the stories in the <cite>Saturday Evening Post</cite> actually come
true. Here a man can look his neighbour straight in the eye
and subscribe—without a smile—to the romantic credo that
all men are equal, in so far as it is possible by energy, hard
work, and regular attendance at divine service, to reach the
highest post in any career. Class barriers are almost unknown,
and on all sides there is an endlessly generous desire to learn,
to help, and to encourage. The traditional boy can still arrive
from the slums of Europe and finish up in the editorial chair of
a wealthy newspaper. If he ever fails to do so it can only be
because he starts by reading the <cite>Liberator</cite>, and devotes to the
deciphering of Thorstein Veblen’s hieroglyphics of socialism
the time which should have been given to mastering the more
profitable technique of Americanism.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> a typical form of primitive society, where institutions and
ideals, collective representations and individual reactions,
coincide, no distinction can be made between culture and civilization.
Every element of the practical culture is a spiritual
symbol, and there is no other logic or reason than that which
is made manifest by the structure and habits of the social
group. Life is a religion, in the two meanings of the word, that
of a binding together of men, and the deeper one—of gathering
the manifold activities of the individual in one compact spiritual
mass. The mythical concepts, which limit and integrate
the data of experience, in a sphere which is neither purely
imaginative nor purely intellectual, present to the individual
mind as irresistibly as to the mind of the group, a world of
complementary objects which are of the same stuff as the
apprehended data. Thought—practical, æsthetic, ethical—is
still undifferentiated, unindividualized, as if a collective mind
were an active reality, a gigantic, obscure, coherent personality,
entering into definite relations with a world homogeneous
with itself.</p>

<p>Such an abstract, ideal scheme of the life of the human
spirit before it has any history, before it is even capable of
history, affords, in its hypothetical indistinction (within the
group, within the individual), a prefiguration of a certain
higher relationship of culture with civilization, of a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">humana
civilitas</i>, in which the practical should be related to the spiritual,
nature to the mind, in the full light of consciousness,
with a perfect awareness of the processes of distinction and
individualization. In the twilight and perspective of historical
knowledge, if not in their actuality, Greece before Socrates,
Rome before Christ, the Middle Ages before Saint Francis
(each of them, before the apparition of the disrupting and
illuminating element of growth), are successive attempts or
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">étapes</i> towards the creation of a civilization of such a kind—a
human civilization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span></p>

<p>Between these two limits—the primitive and the human—the
ideal beginning and the ideal end—we can recognize, at
any given moment in history, through the segmentation and
aggregation of a multitude of cultures, different ages and strata
of culture coexisting in the same social group; and the individual
mind emerges at the confluence of the practical cultures,
with science and philosophy and the ethical, non-tribal
ideals, germs and <em>initia</em>, of the human civilization remaining
above the given society as a soul that never entirely vivifies
its own body. History begins where first the distinction between
civilization and culture appears, or, to state the same
fact from a different angle, where individual consciousness is
born. It ends, ideally, where the same distinction fades away
into Utopia, or death, or the Kingdom of Heaven; where the
highest form of individual consciousness is at no point higher
than the consciousness of the group from which it originally
differentiated itself.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The writer of these pages belongs, by birth, education, and
election, to the civilization of Rome and to the culture, or
cultures, of Italy. The civilization of Rome, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">latina
civilitas</i>, is a complex mind, whose successive phases of growth
are the abstract humanism of ancient Greece, the civic and
legal humanism of Rome, the moral and spiritual humanism
of the Latin church, the æsthetic and metaphysical humanism
of the Renaissance. Each phase is an integration of the preceding
one and the acquisition of a new universal principle,
made independent of the particular social body in which it has
partially realized itself before becoming a pure, intelligible
ideal, an essential element of the human mind. The first three
phases, Greece, Rome, and the Church, are still more or less
closely associated, in relation to the forms of humanism which
are peculiar to each of them, with particular cultures. But the
last one, which, in its progress from the 13th century to
our days, has been assimilating, purifying, and clarifying all
the preceding ones, does not, at any given moment, directly
connect itself with any definite social body. In its inception,
as a purely Italian Renaissance, it may appear as the spiritual
form of Italian society from the 13th to the 15th century; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span>
its apparition coincides with the natural growth of the several,
sharply defined European nationalities, and very soon (and
apart from the evident insufficiency of any individual nation
to fulfil its spiritual exigencies) it manifests its intrinsic character
of universality by overflowing the frontiers of Italy and
becoming the law of the whole Western European world.</p>

<p>The history of Europe during the last six centuries is the
history of the gradual penetration of that idea within the circle
of the passively or actively resistant, or inert, local, national
cultures. The Reformation, of all active resistances, is the
strongest and most important. The Germanic tribes rebel
against the law of Rome, because a delay of from five to ten
centuries in the experience of Christianity, and an experience
of Christianity to be made not on a Græco-Roman, but on an
Odinic background, create in them the spiritual need of an
independent elaboration of the same universal principles. Germany
is practically untouched by the spirit of the Renaissance
until the 18th century, and Italy herself is for two centuries
reduced to spiritual and political servitude by the superior
material strength which accompanies and sustains the spiritual
development of the nations of the North. Through the
whole continent, within the single national units, as well as
between nation and nation, the contrast and collaboration of
the Romanic and Germanic elements, of Renaissance and Reformation,
is the actual dialectic of the development of European
civilization: of the successive approximations of the single
cultures, or groups of cultures, in a multitude of more or
less divergent directions, with alternating accelerations and
involutions, towards the common form, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">humana civilitas</i>.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Of all the nations of Europe, Italy is the only one that,
however contingently and imperfectly, has actually realized all
of the four phases of humanism in a succession of historical
cultures: Magna Græcia, the Roman Empire, the Catholic
Church, the Renaissance. And as each of these successive
cultures was trying to embody in itself a universal, not a
particular, principle, nationality in Italy is not, as for other
nations, the acceptance of certain spiritual limits elaborated
from within the social body, but a reaction to the pressure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span>
of adjoining nationalities, which presented themselves as obstacles
and impediments, even within the life of Italy herself,
to the realization of a super-national principle. This is the
process through which the humanism of the Renaissance, after
having received its abstract political form at the hands of
the thinkers and soldiers of the French Revolution, becomes
active and militant in Mazzini’s principle of nationality, which
is a heroic effort towards the utilization of the natural growth
of European nations for the purposes of a universal civilization.</p>

<p>The distance between that civilization and the actual cultures
of the nations of Europe can easily be measured by the
observer of European events during the last seven years. To
that civilization belong the ideals, to those cultures, the realities,
of the Great War. And all of us who have thought and
fought in it have souls which are irremediably divided between
that civilization and those cultures. If we should limit ourselves
to the consideration of present facts and conditions, we
might well give way to despair: not for a good many years
in the past have nationalities been so impervious to the voice
of the common spirit as they are in Europe to-day. And the
sharp contrast between ideals and realities which has been
made visible even to the blind by the consequences of the
war, has engendered a temper of violence and cynicism even
among those rare men and parties who succeeded in keeping
their ideals <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au dessus de la mêlée</i>, and therefore did not put
them to the destructive test of a promise which had to be
broken.</p>

<p>The moral problem which every nation of Europe will have
to labour at in the immediate future, is that of the relations
of its historical culture or cultures with the exigencies of the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">humana civilitas</i>. It is the problem that presents itself more
or less dimly to the most earnest and thoughtful of Europeans,
when they speak of the coming “death of our civilization,” or
of the “salvaging of civilization.” To many of them, it is
still a problem of institutions and technologies: its essentially
spiritual quality does not seem to have been thoroughly
grasped as yet. But it is also the problem that confronts, less
tragically, with less urgency, but not less inevitably, this great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>
European Commonwealth which has created its own life on
the North American continent for the space of the last three
centuries.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>This European Commonwealth of America owes its origin
to a small number of adventurers and pilgrims, who brought
the seeds of English culture to the new world. Let us very
rapidly attempt a characterization of that original culture.</p>

<p>England holds as peculiar and distinctive a position among
the nations of Europe as Italy. She is the meeting-point of
the Romanic and Germanic elements in European history;
and if her culture may appear as belonging to the family of
mediterranean cultures (to what we have called the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">latina
civilitas</i>), to an English Catholic, like Cardinal Newman, there
was a time, and not very remote, when the Protestant could be
proud of its Teutonic associations. From a Catholic and
Franco-Norman mediæval England, logically emerges, by a
process similar to that exemplified by Italy and France and
Spain, the England of Henry VIII and Elizabeth, of Shakespeare
and the Cavaliers: Renaissance England. She flourishes
between the suppression of the monasteries and the suppression
of the theatres. She moulds, for all centuries to come,
the æsthetic and political mind of the English people. But
she carries the germs of a widely different culture in her womb:
she borrows from them, already during the Elizabethan age,
some traits that differentiate her from all other Renaissance
cultures. And these germs, slowly gaining impetus through
contrast and suppression, ultimately work her overthrow with
the short-lived triumph of Cromwell and the Puritans.</p>

<p>After 1688, the law of English life is a compromise between
Puritan and Cavalier, between Renaissance and Reformation,
which sends the extreme representatives of each type
out of the country, builders of an Empire of adventurers and
pilgrims—while at home the moderate Cavalier, and the moderate
Puritan, the Tory and the Whig, establish a Republic
with a King, and a Parliamentary feudal régime. But the
successive stages of English culture do not interest us at this
point, except in so far as America has always remained closer
to England than to any other European nation, and has again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span>
and again relived in her own life the social, political, spiritual
experiences of the Mother Country.</p>

<p>It is from the two main directions of English spiritual life
that America, through a double process of segmentation, Elizabethan
or Cavalier in the South, Puritan in the North, draws
the origins of her own life. It is in the Cavalier and the Puritan,
still within the circle of English life, that the germs of
American culture must be sought. The peculiar relations of
the Cavalier and the Puritan to the general design of European
civilization define the original attitude of this Commonwealth
beyond the sea towards the other European cultures,
and are the origins of the curves which, modified in their
development by the addition of new elements and by the action
of a new, distinctive environment, American culture has described
and will describe in the future.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Puritanism is essentially a culture and not a civilization.
The Puritan mind, in its quest for an original Christian experience,
falls upon the Old Testament and the Ancient Law. The
God of the tribes of Israel becomes its God, a God finding a
complete expression in the law that rules his chosen people. A
compact, immovable spiritual logic, a set of fixed standards, a
rhetoric of the virtues, the identification of any element of
growth and change with the power of evil, a dualistic morality,
and the consequent negation of a spiritually free will, these
are the characteristics of Puritanism, constituting at the
same time, and with the same elements, a system of truth and
a system of conduct. In both the meanings in which we have
used the word religion at the beginning of this essay, Puritanism
is a perfect, final religion. Transplanted to America
when Europe was slowly becoming conscious of the metaphysical
implications of the destruction of the old Cosmology—when
the discovery of an infinite universe was depriving a
purely transcendent divinity of the place it had been given
beyond the limits of a finite universe—the infinite universe
itself being manifest, in the words of Bruno, as <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">lo specchio della
infinita deità</i>,—it gave birth to an intrinsically static culture,
standing out against a background of transcendental thought.</p>

<p>The principles of growth in Puritanism were not specifically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span>
Puritan: they were those universal values that Puritan discipline
succeeded in rediscovering because every moral discipline,
however fettered by its premises, will inevitably be led towards
them. Quite recently, a sincere and ardent apologist of Puritanism
recognized in a document which he considers as the
highest expression of that culture in America, a paraphrase of
the Roman <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dulce et decorum</i>. The irrationality which breaks
through the most hermetically closed system of logic, in the
process of life, asserts itself by extracting from a narrowly
institutional religion values which are not dependent upon a
particular set of institutions, nor are valid for one people only.
But we might detect the germs of that irrationality already in
the very beginnings of the system, when Milton adds the whole
weight of the Roman tradition to the Puritan conception of
democracy—or in the divine words of the Gospels, through
which in all times and places every <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">anima naturaliter christiana</i>
will hear the cry of Love rebelling against the letter of the
Ancient Law.</p>

<p>What the Cavalier brought to America, we should have to
investigate only if we were tracing the history of divergent
directions, of local cultures: because the original soul of America
is undoubtedly the Puritanic soul of New England, and
the South, even before the War of Secession, in relation to the
main direction, to the general culture, has a merely episodical
significance. Yet, though the founders of New England were
only Puritans, certain traits of the Cavalier spirit, the adventurer
in the pilgrim, will inevitably reappear in their descendants,
repeating the original dichotomy in the generations issuing
from an apparently pure stock: partly, because a difference
in beliefs is not always the mark of a fundamental
difference in temperaments, and partly because those traits
correspond to some of the generally human impulses suppressed
by the choice of the Puritan.</p>

<p>There is one element which is common to Puritan and
Cavalier in America, and which cannot be said to belong in
precisely the same fashion to their ancestors in England. It
is, in England and the rest of Europe, a mythology formed
by similar hopes and desires, by a similar necessity of giving
an imaginary body to certain thoughts and aspirations, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span>
part of the spirit of the Renaissance as well as of the spirit
of the Reformation: a mythology which, in the mind of the
European during the centuries between the discovery of America
and the French Revolution, inhabits such regions as the
island of Utopia, the city of the Sun, and the continent of
America. In that mythology, Utopism and American exoticism
coincide. But the adventurer and the pilgrim were actually
and firmly setting their feet on one of the lands mapped
in that purely ideal geography, and thoughts and aspirations
confined by the European to the continent of dreams, became
the moral exigencies of the new Commonwealth. Thus America
set herself against Europe as the ideal against the real,
the land of the free, and the refuge of the oppressed; and was
confirmed in such a position by her natural opportunities, by
the conditions of pioneer life, by contrast to European despotism—finally,
by the Revolution and the Constitution, in
which she felt that the initial moral exigencies were ultimately
fulfilled. It is to this myth of a Promised Land, which is
neither strictly Puritan nor strictly Cavalier, and yet at times
seems to coincide with the less static aspects of Puritanism,
that a peculiarly American idealism, unconquerable by defeat
and even by the evidence of facts, abstract, self-confident, energetic,
youthful and optimistic, owes its strength and its courage:
an idealism which is hardly conscious of what Europe
has been taught by centuries of dire experience—the irreparable
contingency and imperfection of history; and which believes,
as firmly as the Puritan legislator believes it, that such
institutions have been devised, or can be devised, through which
the ideal law, when thought out and written, will not fail to
become the law of reality for all times to come.</p>

<p>From two contrasting elements, a firm belief in a Law which
was at the beginning, and a romantic mythology, a third characteristic
of the American mind is thus engendered: a full confidence
in the power of intellect conceived as a mechanism apt
to contrive practical schemes for the accomplishment of ideal
ends. This intellectual faith is similar in its static nature to
the moral faith of the Puritan: it is the material weapon of
Puritanism. Perfectibility is within its reach, but not the
actual processes of evolution. The intellect that does not conceive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span>
itself as a process or function, but as a mechanism, can
tend towards, and theoretically possess, a state of perfection,
but will resent and condemn the gropings and failings of actual,
imperfect growth and change. Not without reason, the greatest
individual tragedy of the war, in a typically American
mind confronted with the sins and misery of Europe, was a
tragedy of intellectual pride: of the inability of a static intellect
to become charitably active in the tragic flux of European
life; a tragedy which a little moral and intellectual humility
might well have spared to the generous hopes of America,
and the childish, messianic faith which irradiated for only too
short a time the bleeding soul of Europe.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>If we have called Puritanism a culture, what name shall we
reserve for that vast and complicated collection of mechanical
contrivances which constitute the material body of American
society to-day? We are in the presence of a technology, a
more highly developed one, perhaps (with the possible exception
of Germany before the war), than any that has ever existed
in the world. Technologies have a logic of their own, and
that logic is apt to take the place of higher spiritual constructions;
either when conditions of life lend a miraculous character
to the means of sustaining life itself and invest the practical
actions of hunting or agriculture with a religious significance;
or when the complexity of their organization is such
that the workings of that practical logic inevitably transcend
the power of observation of the individual agent, however
highly placed in the machinery itself, and moral or intellectual
myths are born of an imperfect knowledge. This is the case
of America, and in America this technological or industrial
mythology has crushed out of existence the rival myths of the
farms and the prairie, allowing them a purely romantic value
and decorative function, through the industrially controlled
power of the press. Even pioneering, and the conquest of
the West, a process in which Americans of another age found
an energetic, if partly vicarious, satisfaction for certain moral
and ideal yearnings, has receded, in the mind of Americans of
to-day, into the shades of a fabulous and solemn background.</p>

<p>The industrial revolution followed in America the lines of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">517</span>
development of its early English model. This commonwealth
beyond the sea, agricultural and democratic, found in itself the
same elements which gave birth in the original country to an
industrial feudalism, grafting itself, without any solution of
continuity, on a feudalism of the land. The ineradicable
optimism of the American invested the whole process with
the same halo of moral romance which had coloured the age
of pioneering, and accepted as a useful substitute (or rather, as
a new content) for Puritanic moralism the philosophy of opportunity
and of success constantly commensurate with true merit.
The conception of intellect as a mechanism to be used for
moral and ideal ends, gave way to a similar though more complex
conception, modelled not on the methods of pure science,
from whose early conquests the revolution itself had been
started, but on those of applied science or of practical machinery.</p>

<p>When, in the natural course of events, the bonds which
kept together the purely economic elements of the country
became more powerful and real than any system of political
institutions, when, in fact, a financial syndicalism became the
structure underlying the apparent organs of government, all
the original ideals of America had already gathered to the
defence of the new order. Hence the extraordinary solidity of
the prevailing economic system in this country, when compared
with any European country. Economic, as well as political
systems, ultimately rest on convictions rather than on
sheer force, and the radical in America, in all spheres of
thought, is constantly in the necessity of fighting not mere
institutions, as in Europe, but institutionalized ideals, organisms
and personalities which establish their right on the same
assumptions which prompt him in his rebellion. There is less
difference in fundamentals between a Carnegie and a Debs
than between any two individuals placed in similar positions
in Europe.</p>

<p>An interesting by-product of this particular development is
the myth of the captain of industry, possessed, in the popular
imagination, of all the virtues. And a consequence of this
myth is an unavoidable revision of the catalogue of virtues,
from which some were expunged that do not lead to industrial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span>
success, and others were admitted because industrial success
is thought to be impossible without them. This myth is not
believed in by the aspiring multitudes only, but by a good
many among the captains of industry themselves, who accept
their wealth as a social trust, and conceive of their function in
a manner not dissimilar from that of the old sovereign by the
grace of God.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>This transposition of ideals from the religious and moral
field to the practical and economic, leaves only a very thin
ground for personal piety and the religion of the Churches.
Yet there is no country in the world (again, with the only possible
exception of Northern Africa during the first centuries of
the Christian Era) which has produced such a wealth and such
a variety of religious movements as America. The substance
of that very thin ground is diluted Puritanism, Puritanism
which, in a vast majority of the population, converts itself,
strangely enough, as we have seen, into social optimism, a
belief sufficient to the great active masses, but not to the needs
of “the heart,” when the heart is given enough leisure to consider
itself, through either too much wealth or too little hope:
through the discovery of its emptiness, when the possession of
the means makes manifest the absence of an end, or through
the spasms of its hunger, when means are beyond reach, in
the hands of the supposed inferior and unworthy. In this
second case, even a purely sensual craving dignifies itself with
the name of the Spirit. The more or less official Churches,
in an attempt to retain the allegiance of their vast congregations,
have followed the masses in their evolution: they pride
themselves essentially on their social achievements, a little
doubtfully, perhaps, knowing that their particular God has
no more reason to inhabit a church than a factory, and that
the highest possible embodiment of their doctrine is an orderly
and paternally governed industrial organization.</p>

<p>To the needs of “the heart” minister the innumerable sects
(and here again, the American religious history repeats, in magnified
proportions, the characteristics of English religious life).
But because of the gradual impoverishment of the central religious
tradition of the country, because of the scanty cultural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span>
background of both apostles and neophytes, it is hard to recognize
in the whole movement an intimate spiritual dialectic
which might lend strength and significance to the individual
sects. A vague mysticism appropriates to itself, in a haphazard
and capricious fashion, shadows and ghosts of religious
experiences and opinions, whose germs of truth lie in other
ages and other climates. The only common feature seems to
be a distrust of intellect, derived from the original divorce of
the intellectual from the spiritual in the Puritan, a distrust
which at times becomes active in the denunciation of the supposed
crimes of science. It is this fundamental common feature
which will for ever prevent any of them from becoming
what all sects fail to be, a religion.</p>

<p>The two states of mind which are nearer to-day to being
true religions are, on one side, Americanism (a religion as a
common bond), and on the other, Radicalism (a religion as
a personal experience). Americanism is the more or less perfect
expression of the common belief that American ideals
realize themselves in American society. Radicalism is the
more or less spasmodic protest against such a belief, sometimes
coupled with an individual attempt at realizing those ideals in
one’s life and actions. The sharpest contrast between the two
attitudes is to be found in their ideas of political and spiritual
freedom; which to one is a condition actually existing by the
mere fact of the existence of American society such as it is,
and to the other a dynamic principle which can never be permanently
associated with any particular set of institutions.</p>

<p>The original spirit of Puritanism can hardly be said to be
alive to-day in America. In a few intellectuals, it confuses
itself with other high forms of moral discipline in the past,
and reappears with a strange fidelity to form rather than substance,
as Platonism, Classicism, Mediævalism, Catholicism, or
any other set of fixed standards that can be accepted as a
whole, and can give the soul that sense of security which is
inherent in the illusion of possessing the final truth. The consequence
of such a deviation is that these truly religious souls,
after having satisfied themselves with a sufficiently vast and
beautiful interpretation of their creed, resent any cruder and
more dangerous form of intellectual experience much more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span>
keenly than they resent crudities and dangers actually present
in the nature of things. They are intellectuals, but again, with
no faith in intellect; they are truly isolated among their fellow-countrymen,
and yet they believe in conformity, and assume
the conformity of American society to be the conformity of
their dreams.</p>

<p>Such a static apprehension of truth, such an identification
of universal spiritual values with one or another particular
tradition, is in fact as much an obstacle to the new life of
the human spirit as the external conformity enforced by social
optimism. But the polemic against the older intellectuals is
carried on by younger men, many of them of recent immigrant
blood, but all of them reared in the atmosphere of American
culture, and who differ from them more in the objects of their
preference than in the vastness or depth of their outlook.
There is a way of clinging to the latest fashion in philosophy or
in art which is not a progress in any sense in relation to older
faiths; of combating a manifest logical fallacy by the use of
the same sophism; of embracing sin with the same moral enthusiasm
that in less enlightened times was kept in reserve for
the highest virtues only.</p>

<p>More important, for their influence on certain phases of
American life, than these intellectual echoes, are the moralistic
remnants of Puritanism. It is always possible, for small
groups of people, strongly endowed with the sense of other
people’s duties, to intimidate large sections of public opinion
into accepting the logical consequences of certain undisputed
moral assumptions, however widely they may differ from the
realities of American life. It is under such circumstances that
the kind-hearted, easy-going American pays the penalty for
his identification of realities with ideals, by being deprived of
some very dear reality in the name of an ideal which had
long since ceased to have any meaning for him.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>From whatever side we look at American culture, we are
constantly brought face to face with a disregard or distrust,
or a narrow conception, of purely intellectual values, which
seems to be the common characteristic of widely divergent
spiritual attitudes. The American does not, as the Englishman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span>
glory in his capacity for muddling through: he is proud
of certain logical achievements, and has a fondness for abstract
schemes, an earnest belief in their validity and efficiency;
but no more than the English does he believe that
intellect is an integral part of the human personality. He
recognizes the identity of goodness and truth, provided that
truth can be found out by other means than purely intellectual:
by common sense, by revelation, by instinct, by imagination,
but not by intellect. It is here that even the defenders,
among Americans, of the classical tradition miss the true meaning
of the message of Socrates and Plato, the foundation of
humanism.</p>

<p>What is peculiarly American in the opinions of American
philosophers is a clear and distinct expression of the common
attitude. The official philosophy of America has repeated for
a century the views of English empiricists and of German idealists,
sometimes with very interesting and illuminating personal
variations. It has even, and it is an original achievement,
brought them to lose their peculiar accents and to coincide in
new theories of knowledge. But the heart of American philosophy
is not there: it is in pragmatism, in instrumentalism,
in whatever other theory clearly establishes the purely functional
character of truth, the mechanical aspect of intellect.
Having put the criterion of truth outside the intellect, and
considered intellect as the mere mechanism of belief, these
doctrines try to re-establish the dignity of intellect by making
of it a machine for the reproduction of morally or socially
useful beliefs. The operation is similar to that of an anatomist
who, having extracted the heart from a living body, would presume
to reconstruct the body by artificially promoting the
movements of the heart. The doctrine of the purely pragmatic
or instrumental nature of intellect, which is the logical clarification
of the popular conception, is a doctrine of radical scepticism,
whatever the particular declarations of faith of the
philosophers themselves might say to the contrary: it destroys
not the objects of knowledge only, but the instrument itself.</p>

<p>American philosophers came to this doctrine through the
psychological and sociological approach to the problems of
the mind. Such an approach is in keeping with the general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span>
tendency towards assuming the form of natural and mathematical
sciences, which moral sciences in American universities
have been obeying during the last thirty or forty years, partly
under the influence of a certain kind of European positivism,
and partly because of the prestige that natural and mathematical
sciences gained from their practical applications.
Even now it is easier to find a truly humanistic mind, a sound
conception of intellectual values, among the great American
scientists than among the philosophers and philologists: but
pure science has become the most solitary of occupations, and
the scientist the most remote of men, since his place in society
has been taken by the inventor and by the popularizer. Psychology
and sociology, those half-literary, half-scientific disciplines,
gave as a basis to philosophy not the individual effort
to understand and to think, but the positive observation of the
more or less involuntary processes of thought in the multitude.
Intellect was sacrificed to a democratic idea of the equality of
minds: how could the philosopher presume to think, I do not
say better or more efficiently than, but differently from the
multitude? To European philosophy the reproach has been
made again and again, and with some justice, of imposing laws
upon reality which are only the laws of individual philosophic
thought; and yet what else does the scientist ultimately do?
But both scientist and philosopher find their justification in
their faith in the validity of their instruments: in a spirit of
devotion and humility, not in a gratuitous presumption. The
typical American philosopher has sold his birthright, not for
a pottage of lentils, but for mere love.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>I am painfully aware of the fact that, through the meshes
of this necessarily abstract and sketchy analysis, a good deal
of the beauty and vastness, the vigour and good-humour of
American life inevitably escapes. The traveller from the old
countries experiences here a sense of great spaces and of practically
unbounded possibilities, which reflects itself in an unparalleled
gaiety and openness of heart, and freedom of social
intercourse. The true meaning of the doctrine of opportunity
lies much more in these individual attitudes than in any difference
between the structures of American and European<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span>
societies. And I do not believe that the only explanation for
them is in the prosperity of America when compared to the
misery of Europe, because this generosity stands in no direct
relation with individual wealth. The lumberman and the longshoreman
are as good as, if not better than, the millionaire.</p>

<p>These individual attitudes find their collective expression
in the idea of, and readiness for, service, which is universal
in this country. Churches, political parties, movements for
social reform, fraternal orders, industrial and business organizations,
meet on this common ground. There is no material
interest or spiritual prejudice that will not yield to an appeal
for service: and whenever the object of service is clearly
defined, action follows the impulse, intolerant of any delay.
But Service is a means and not an end: you can serve a God,
or a man, or a group of men, and in that man or group of men
what you conceive to be his or their need, but you cannot serve
Service. And the common end can only be given by a clear
intellectual vision of the relations between a set of ideals and
the realities of life.</p>

<p>This intrinsic generosity of the American people is the motive
of the song, and the substance of the ideal, of the one great
poet that America has added to the small family of European
poets: Walt Whitman. In him that feeling and that impulse
became a vision and a prophecy. There is a habit on the
part of American intellectuals to look with a slight contempt
on the admiration of Europeans for the poetry of Walt Whitman,
as just another symptom of their ignorance of American
things. But I, for one, will confess that what I have loved
passionately, as little more than a boy, in that poetry, is that
same quality whose presence I have now recognized as the
human flower of American culture, and which makes me love
this country as passionately as I loved that poetry.</p>

<p>It is one of the many paradoxes of American intellectual
life that even the cultural preparation of a Walt Whitman
should have been deeper and more substantial, if not more
systematic, than that of any professor or writer of his times.
These were minds which had as fully imbibed European
thought and imagination as any professor or writer in Europe:
but that thought, that imagination, transplanted to the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span>
country, stood in no real relation with the new practical and
moral surroundings, and were therefore thin and sterile. Walt
Whitman knew and understood the great traditions of European
civilization, and tried to express them in the original
idiom, moral and literary, of his America.</p>

<p>But <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">nemo propheta</i>, and it takes centuries to understand a
poet. Walt Whitman still waits for his own generation. The
modern schools of American poetry, curious of all winds of
fashion, working for the day rather than for the times, have
not yet fully grasped, I do not say the spirit of his message,
but even, for all their free-versifying, the mystery of his magnificent
rhythms. His successors are rather among some of
the younger novelists, and in a few men, spiritually related to
them, who approach the study of American conditions from
a combined economic and psychological point of view. The
novelists are busy in discovering the actual traits of the American
physiognomy, with sufficient faith in the future to describe
the shades with as much care as the lights, and with a deeper
passion; the economists are making way for the highest and
purest American ideals by revealing the contingent and merely
psychological basis of the supposedly scientific axioms of classical
economics.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>My own experience of American life, between the autumn
of 1919 and the summer of 1921, has brought me in contact
with all sorts and manners of people from one end to the other
of the country, from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It is from
this direct intercourse with Americans, rather than from my
readings of American literature, continued for a much longer
time, that I have formed the opinions expressed in this paper.
But as my work has brought me in closer communion with colleges
and universities than with any other kind of institutions,
I feel a little more assured in writing of the educational aspect
of the American problem.</p>

<p>A university is in any case more a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">universitas studentium</i>
than a corporation of professors. I have enjoyed my life in
American faculties, and I have gained a good deal from the
many noble souls and intellects that I have met among them;
but, whenever it has been possible to me, I have escaped from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span>
the faculties to the students and tried to understand the tendencies
of the coming generations.</p>

<p>The students of the American college or university, from the
comparatively ancient institutions of the East, to the young
co-educational schools of the Middle and Far West, form a
fairly homogeneous, though very widely representative, cross-section
of the American community. They are, in a very precise
and inclusive meaning, young America, the America of to-morrow.
A good many of their intellectual and spiritual characteristics
are the common traits of American culture which
we have studied in the preceding paragraphs; and yet, because
of the social separation of individuals according to ages,
which is carried in this country much farther than in any
European country, they develop also a number of independent
traits, which are peculiar to each one of the “younger generations”
in their turn. The life of the American boy or girl,
up to the time of their entrance into college, is mainly the life
of a beautiful and healthy young organism, not subject to any
too strict intellectual or spiritual discipline. The High Schools
seem to understand their function in a spirit which is substantially
different from that of the European secondary schools,
owing especially to certain prevailing educational doctrines
founded on a fiction which is used also in many other fields
of American life, but which in the field of education has
wrought more harm than in any other one, the fiction of the
public demand—in this particular case of one or another type
of education. A fiction undoubtedly it is, and used to give
prestige and authority to the theories of individual educationalists,
since in no country and in no time there have existed
educational opinions outside the circle of the educators themselves.
But this fiction has unfortunately had practical consequences
because American educators, subject to big business
in the private institutions, and to the politicians in the State
schools and universities, have not found in themselves the
energy, except in a few isolated instances, to resist what came
to them strengthened by such auspices. And the public itself
was easily convinced that it wanted what it was told that it
wanted. The students, more sinned against than sinning,
enjoy the easy atmosphere of the school, and it is only when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span>
they reach college that they become aware of their absolute
unpreparedness for the higher studies.</p>

<p>This consciousness of their inferiority manifests itself in an
attitude of “low-browism,” which is not contempt of that
which they think is beyond them, but rather an unwillingness
to pretend that they are what they know they are not. It is
practically impossible for them to acquire any standards in
matters of scholarship, and they are thus forcibly thrown back
on that which they know very well, the sports, and social life
among themselves. A Chinese friend of mine once quaintly
defined an American university as an athletic association in
which certain opportunities for study were provided for the
feeble-bodied. Now, in athletics and social life, the student
finds something that is real, and therefore is an education: there
is no pretence or fraud about football, and in their institutions
within the college and the university the students obey certain
standards and rules which are not as clearly justified as those
of athletics, but still are made by themselves, and therefore
readily understood. They are standards and rules that sometimes
strangely resemble those of primitive society, as it is
only too natural when the ground on which they grow is a
community of the very young only, and yet undoubtedly they
are a preparation for a life after college in which similar features
are very far from being the exception. And besides, that
social life has a freedom and beauty of its own, evident in one
at least of its most hallowed institutions, the dance. American
dances, with those captivating and vital rhythms which
American music has appropriated for itself from the Negro,
are a perfect expression of the mere joy of life. The older
generations are shocked and mystified by these dances, and
also by many other ways and by the implicit opinions of the
young; but so they have been in all ages and countries. To
a curious and passionate observer, the youth of America seems
to be obscurely labouring at a liberation of the sexual life
from pretences and unjustified inhibitions, and, through an
original experience of the elements of love, at a creation of new
values, perhaps of a new morality.</p>

<p>But the student is an object of perplexity and wonder to
the professor, who generally ends by taking very seriously,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span>
very literally, as something that cannot be changed, his attitude
towards athletics and the social life of the college. Starting
from such an assumption, the professor becomes shy of
teaching; that is, he keeps for himself whatever true intellectual
and spiritual interests he may have, and deals out to
the students in the classroom rations of knowledge, which go
up to form a complicated system of units and credits symbolizing
the process of education. There is, to my mind, no
more tragic misunderstanding in American life.</p>

<p>My own experience (and I give it for what it is worth) tells
me that athletics and the social life are vicarious satisfactions
for much deeper spiritual and intellectual needs. The student
receives from the common American tradition a desire for spiritual
values; from his individual reaction to that tradition,
a craving for intellectual clarity. But he is handicapped by
his scholastic unpreparedness, and disillusioned by the aloofness
of the professor, by the intricacies and aridity of the curriculum:
by the fact, only too evident to him, that what he is
given is not science or thought, but their scholastic version.
Whenever a man stands before him, and without trying to
“put himself at his level,” talks to him as one talks to a man,
thinking for him as one thinks for oneself, there is no more
ready and enthusiastic response to be had than from the
American student. He is not afraid of the difficulties or
dangers, but he must trust his guide, and know that his guide
trusts him. There is evidence for this in the cases which are
too frequent to be called mere exceptions, of those American
professors who are truly popular in the colleges and universities.
But until many more of them realize what splendid
material is in their hands, what big thirst there is for them to
quench, and go back to their work with this new faith, the
gulf will not be bridged, and young America will have to attempt
to solve her own problems without the help of the
spiritual experience of the centuries.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>This condition in the institutions of higher learning is a symbol
and a mirror of the condition of the country. With an
impoverished religious tradition, with an imperfect knowledge
of the power of intellect, America is starving for religious and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span>
intellectual truth. No other country in the world has, as the
phrase goes, a heart more full of service: a heart that is constantly
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quaerens quem amet</i>. With the war, and after the war,
America has wished to dedicate herself to the world, and has
only withdrawn from action when she has felt that she could
not trust her leaders, what was supposed to be her mind.</p>

<p>In a few years, the children of the recent millions of immigrants
from all regions of Europe will come forward in American
life and ask for their share in the common inheritance of
American tradition, in the common work of American civilization.
They will not have much to contribute directly from
their original cultures, but they will add an unexampled variety
of bloods, of intellectual and moral temperaments, to the
population of America. Their Americanization, in habits and
language and manners, is a natural process which, left to itself,
invariably takes place in the second generation. America
must clarify and intensify her tradition, the moral discipline
of the Puritan, the moral enthusiasm of the Discoverers and
Pioneers, for them, and they will gladly embrace her heritage;
but this clarification and intensification is only possible
through the revision of the original values in the light of the
central humanistic tradition of European thought.</p>

<p>The dreams of the European founders of this Commonwealth
of Utopia may yet come true, in the way in which human
dreams come true, by becoming the active, all-pervading
motive of spiritual effort, the substance of life. Exiles, voluntary
or forced, from England and Ireland, from Russia and
Italy, from Germany and Israel, children of one mother, unified
in America as they will not be unified for centuries to come
in Europe, will thus have a chance to anticipate, in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">civilitas
americana</i>, the future developments of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">humana civilitas</i>.</p>

<p>And if this generation needs a motto, I would suggest one
line of Dante:</p>

<h3>THE CITY</h3>

<p>There is no adequate literature of cities in America. Some of
the larger cities possess guide-books and local histories; but the
most valuable illuminations on the history and development of the
American city lie buried in contemporary papers, narratives of
travel, and speeches. The reader who wishes to explore the ground
farther should dip into volumes and papers drawn from all periods.
The recent editions of “Valentine’s Manual” should be interesting
to those who cannot consult the original “Manual of the Common
Council of New York.” During the last twenty years a great many
reports and surveys have been printed, by city planning commissions
and other bodies: these are valuable both for showing the limitations
of the established régime and for giving hints of the forces
that are working, more or less, for improvement. “The Pittsburgh
Survey” (Russell Sage Foundation) is the great classic in this field.
A compendious summary of American city developments during the
last generation is contained in Charles Zueblin’s “American
Municipal Progress” (Macmillan). Standing by itself in this literature
is a very able book by Paul Harlan Douglass, called “The
Little Town,” published by Macmillan. (A book which shall deal
similarly with the Great Town is badly needed.) The best
general approach to the city is that of Professor Patrick Geddes in
“Cities in Evolution” (Williams and Norgate, London.) Those
who are acquainted with Professor Geddes’s “A Study in City
Development” or his contributions to “Sociological Papers” (Macmillan,
1905, 1906, 1907) will perhaps note my debt to him: I
hasten heartily to acknowledge this, as well as my debt, by personal
intercourse, to his colleague, Mr. Victor V. Branford. If the lay
reader can learn nothing else from Professor Geddes, he can learn
the utility of throwing aside the curtains of second-hand knowledge
and studying cities and social institutions by direct observation.
The inadequacy of American civic literature will not be altogether
a handicap if it forces the reader to obtain by personal explorations
impressions which he would otherwise get through the blur of
the printed page. Every city and its region is in a sense an exhibition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span>
of natural and social history. Let the reader walk the streets of
our cities, as through the halls of a museum, and use the books that
have been suggested only as so many tickets and labels. Americans
have a reputation in Europe as voracious sightseers. One wonders
what might not happen if Americans started to see the sights at
home—not the Grand Canyon and the Yosemite, but a “Broadway,”
and its back alleys, and the slums and suburbs that stretch beyond.
If observation led to criticism, and criticism to knowledge, where
might not knowledge lead?</p>

<h3>POLITICS</h3>

<p>The standard works on the history of American politics are so
well known (and so few) that they scarcely need mention. Bryce,
Ostrogorski and de Tocqueville, I assume, have been read by all
serious students, as have also such personal memoirs as those of
Blaine and John Sherman. Bryce’s work is a favourite, but it suffers
from the disingenuousness of the man. Dr. Charles A. Beard’s
“Economic Interpretation of the Constitution” is less a complete
treatise than a prospectus of a history that is yet to be written.
As far as I know, the valuable suggestions in his preface have never
inspired any investigation of political origins by other American
historians, most of whom are simply unintelligent school-teachers, as
their current “histories” of the late war well show. All such inquiries
are blocked by the timorousness and stupidity that are so
characteristic of American scholarship. Our discussion of politics,
like our discussion of economics, deals chiefly with superficialities.
Both subjects need ventilation by psychologists not dependent upon
college salaries, and hence free to speak. Certainly the influence of
religious enthusiasm upon American politics deserves a careful study;
nevertheless, I have never been able to find a book upon it. Again,
there is the difficult question of the relations between politics and
journalism. My belief is that the rising power of newspapers has
tended to drive intelligent and self-respecting men out of politics,
for the newspapers are chiefly operated by cads and no such man
wants to be at their mercy. But that sort of thing is never studied
in the United States. We even lack decent political biography, so
common in England. The best light to be obtained upon current
politics is in the <cite>Congressional Record</cite>. It costs $1.50 a month and
is well worth it. Soon or late the truth gets into the <cite>Record</cite>; it
even got there during the war. But it seldom gets into the newspapers
and it never gets into books.</p>

<h3>JOURNALISM</h3>

<p>I know of no quite satisfactory book on American journalism.
“History of Journalism in the United States” by George Henry
Payne and “History of American Journalism” by James Melvin
Lee are fairly good in their treatment of the past, but neither of
them shows any penetration in analyzing present conditions. The
innocence of Mr. Payne may be judged by his opinion that the
Kansas City <cite>Star</cite>, under Nelson, exemplifies a healthier kind of
“reform journalism” than the <cite>Post</cite> under Godkin! “Liberty and
the News” by Walter Lippmann is suggestive, but it does not pretend
to contain any specific information. More specific in naming
names and giving modern instances is a short essay by Hamilton
Holt, “Commercialism and Journalism.” “The Brass Check” by
Upton Sinclair contains much valuable material, and perhaps what
I have said of it does not do it justice; certainly it should be read
by everybody interested in this subject. Will Irwin published in
<cite>Collier’s Weekly</cite> from January to July, 1911, a valuable series of
articles, “The American Newspaper: A Study of Journalism.” I
cannot find that these articles have been reprinted in book form.
There is some information in autobiographies and biographies of
important journalists, such as “Recollections of a Busy Life” by
Horace Greeley, “Life of Whitelaw Reid” by Royal Cortissoz,
“Life and Letters of E. L. Godkin” by Rollo Ogden, “Life of
Charles A. Dana” by J. H. Wilson, “Life and Letters of John Hay”
by William Roscoe Thayer, “An Adventure with Genius: Recollections
of Joseph Pulitzer,” by Alleyne Ireland; also “The Story
of the <cite>Sun</cite>” by Frank M. O’Brien. Biographies, however, celebrate
persons and only indirectly explain institutions. A useful bibliography,
which includes books and magazine articles, is “Daily Newspapers
in U. S.” by Wieder Callie of the Wisconsin University School
of Journalism. But after all the best source of information is the
daily newspaper, if one knows how to read it—and read between the
lines.</p>

<h3>THE LAW</h3>

<p>“Bryce’s Modern Democracies,” Chapter XLIII, is a recent survey
of the American legal system; Raymond Fosdick, “American
Police Systems,” Chapter I, states the operation of criminal law.
For legal procedure, see Reginald Heber Smith, “Justice and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span>
Poor,” published by the Carnegie Endowment for the Advancement
of Teaching and dealing with legal aid societies and other methods
of securing more adequate legal relief; Charles W. Eliot and others,
“Efficiency in the Administration of Justice,” published by the National
Economic League; Moorfield Storey, “The Reform of Legal
Procedure;” and many other books and articles; the reports of the
American and New York Bar Associations are of especial value.
John H. Wigmore, “Evidence,” vol. V (1915 edition) discusses
recent progress; see his “Cases on Torts, Preface,” on substantive
law. A very wide range of topics in American law, philosophical,
historical, procedural, and substantive, is covered by the writings of
Roscoe Pound, of which a list is given in “The Centennial History of
the Harvard Law School.” The same book deals with many phases
of legal education; see also “The Case Method in American Law
Schools,” Josef Redlich, Carnegie Endowment. For the position
of lawyers, the best book is, Charles Warren, “A History of the
American Bar;” a recent discussion of their work is Simeon E.
Baldwin, “The Young Man and the Law.” No one interested in
this field should fail to read the “Collected Legal Papers of Justice
Holmes;” see also John H. Wigmore, “Justice Holmes and the Law
of Torts” and Felix Frankfurter, “The Constitutional Opinions of
Justice Holmes,” both in the <cite>Harvard Law Review</cite>, April, 1916,
and Roscoe Pound, “Judge Holmes’s Contributions to the Science
of Law,” <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ibid.</i>, March, 1921. A valuable essay on Colonial legal
history is Paul S. Reinsch, “English Common Law in the Early
American Colonies.” A mass of material will be found in the law
reviews, which are indexed through 1907 by Jones, “Index to Legal
Periodicals,” 3 vols., and afterwards in the <cite>Law Library Journal</cite>,
cumulative quarterly.</p>

<h3>EDUCATION</h3>

<p>The ideas contained in the article are so commonplace and of such
general acceptance among educators that it is impossible to give
specific authority for them. In addition to the articles mentioned,
one of the latest by Dr. D. S. Miller, “The Great College Illusion”
in the <cite>New Republic</cite> for June 22, 1921, should be referred to. For
the rest the report of the Committee of Ten of the National Education
Association, and the reports of President Eliot and President
Lowell of Harvard, President Meiklejohn of Amherst, and President
Wilson of Princeton, may be cited, with the recognition that any
such selection is invidious.</p>

<h3>SCHOLARSHIP AND CRITICISM</h3>

<p>There has been no really fundamental discussion of American
scholarship or American criticism. Those who merely seek a good
historical sketch of our older literary scholarship, along conventional
lines, will find one in the fourth volume of the “Cambridge
History of American Literature” that is at all events vastly superior
to the similar chapters in the “Cambridge History of English Literature.”
But more illuminating than any formal treatise are the comments
on our scholarly ideals and methods in Emerson’s famous
address on “The American Scholar,” in “The Education of Henry
Adams,” and in the “Letters” of William James. The “Cambridge
History of American Literature” contains no separate chapter on
American criticism, and the treatment of individual critics is
pathetically inadequate. The flavour of recent criticism may be
savoured in Ludwig Lewisohn’s interesting anthology, “A Modern
Book of Criticism,” where the most buoyant and “modern” of our
younger men are set side by side with all their unacademic masters
and compeers of the contemporary European world. All that can
be said in favour of the faded moralism of the older American
criticism is urged in an article on “The National Genius” in the
<cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite> for January, 1921, the temper of which may be
judged from this typical excerpt: “When Mr. Spingarn declares that
beauty is not concerned with truth or morals or democracy, he
makes a philosophical distinction which I have no doubt that
Charles the Second would have understood, approved, and could,
at need, have illustrated. But he says what the American schoolboy
knows to be false to the history of beauty in this country. Beauty,
whether we like it or not, has a heart full of service.” The case
against the conservative and traditional type of criticism is presented
with slapdash pungency in the two volumes of H. L.
Mencken’s “Prejudices.” But any one can make out a case for
himself by reading the work of any American classical scholar side
by side with a book by Gilbert Murray, or any history of literature
by an American side by side with Francesco de Sanctis’s “History
of Italian Literature,” or the work of any American critic side by
side with the books of the great critics of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span></p>

<h3>SCHOOL AND COLLEGE LIFE</h3>

<p>The “distinguished Englishman” to whom the Martian refers
is of course Viscount Bryce, whose “American Commonwealth” discusses
the external aspects of our uniformity, the similarity of our
buildings, cities, customs, and so on. Our spiritual unanimity has
been most thoroughly examined by George Santayana, both in his
earlier essays—as notably in “The Genteel Tradition”—and in his
recent “Character and Opinion in the United States.”</p>

<p>For all the welter of writing about our educational establishment,
only infrequent and incidental consideration has been bestowed,
either favourably or unfavourably, on its regimental effect. As custodians
of a going concern, the educators have busied themselves
with repairs and replacements to the machinery rather than with the
right of way; and lay critics have pretty much confined themselves
to selecting between machines whose slightly differing routes all lie
in the same general direction. The exception that proves the rule
is “Shackled Youth,” by Edward Yeomans.</p>

<p>But undergraduate life in America has a genre of its own, the
form of fiction known as “college stories.” Nearly every important
school has at some time had written round it a collection of tales
that exploit its peculiar legends, traditions, and customs—for the
most part a chafing-dish literature of pranks, patter, and athletic
prowess whose murky and often distorted reflection of student attitudes
is quite incidental to its business of entertaining. Owen
Johnson’s Lawrenceville stories—“The Prodigious Hickey,” “Tennessee
Shad,” “The Varmint,” “The Humming Bird”—are the
classics of preparatory school life. Harvard has “Pepper,” by H. E.
Porter, “Harvard Episodes” and “The Diary of a Freshman,” by
Charles Flandrau, and Owen Wister’s “Philosophy 4,” the best of
all college yarns. Yale has the books of Ralph D. Paine and of
others. The Western universities have such volumes as “Ann Arbor
Tales,” by Karl Harriman, for Michigan, and “Maroon Tales,” by
W. J. Cuppy, for Chicago. George Fitch writes amusingly about
life in the smaller Western colleges in “Petey Simmons at Siwash”
and “At Good Old Siwash.”</p>

<p>The catalogue of serious college fiction is brief, and most of the
novels are so propagandist that they are misrepresentative. For
example, Owen Johnson’s “Stover at Yale,” which was some years
out of date when it was published, misses the essential club spirit in
New Haven by almost as wide a margin as Arthur Train’s “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span>
World and Thomas Kelly” departs from the normal club life in
Cambridge; both authors set up the straw man of snobbery where
snobs are an unimportant minority. Two recent novels, however,
deal more faithfully with the college scene for the very reason that
their authors were more interested in character than in setting:
“This Side of Paradise,” by Scott Fitzgerald, is true enough to
have provoked endless controversy in Princeton; and “Salt: The
Education of Griffith Adams,” by Charles G. Norris, is a memorable
appraisal of student ideals in a typical co-educational institution.
Dorothy Canfield’s “The Bent Twig” is also laid in a co-educational
college. Booth Tarkington’s “Ramsay Milholland” attends a State
University; and the hero of “Gold Shod,” by Newton Fuessle, is
a revelatory failure of the University of Chicago regimen. To these
add an autobiography—“An American in the Making, The Life
Story of an Immigrant,” by M. E. Ravage, whose candid report on
his fellows at the Missouri State University is a masterpiece of sympathetic
criticism.</p>

<h3>THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE</h3>

<p>To attempt to give references to specific books on so general and
inclusive a topic would be an impertinence. But one may legitimately
suggest the trends of investigation one would like to see
thoroughly explored. In my own case they would be: (1) a study
of the pioneer from the point of view of his cultural and religious
interests, correlating those interests with his general economic status;
(2) a study of the revolutionary <em>feeling</em> of America (not formulas)
in psychological terms and of its duration as an emotional driving
force; (3) a study of the effects of the post-Civil War period and
the industrial expansion upon the position of upper-class women in
the United States; (4) a study of sexual maladjustment in American
family life, correlated again with the economic status of the successful
pioneer; (5) a very careful study of the beginnings, rise, and
spread of women’s clubs, and their purposes and accomplishments,
correlated chronologically with the development of club life of men
and the extent of vice, gambling, and drunkenness; (6) a study of
American religions in more or less Freudian terms as compensations
for neurotic maladjustment; (7) a study of instrumentalism in
philosophy and its implications for reform; (8) a serious attempt
to understand and appraise the more or less disorganized <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">jeunes</i>,
with some attention to comparing the intensity of their bitterness
or optimism with the places of birth and upbringing. No special<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">538</span>
study of American educational systems or of the school or college
life would be necessary, it seems to me, beyond, of course, a general
knowledge. The intellectual life of the nation, after all, has little
relation to the academic life.</p>

<p>When such special studies had been finished by sympathetic investigators,
probably one of several writers could synthesize the results
and give us a fairly definitive essay on the intellectual life of America.
Such studies, however, have not yet been done, and without them I
have had to write this essay to a certain extent <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en plein air</i>. Thus
it has been impossible entirely to avoid giving the impression of
stating things dogmatically or intuitively. But as a matter of fact
on all the topics I have suggested for study I have already given
much thought and time, and consequently, whatever its literary form,
the essay is not pure impressionism.</p>

<h3>SCIENCE</h3>

<p>There is no connected account of American achievement in science.
Strangely enough, the most pretentious American book on the history
of science, Sedgwick and Tyler’s “Short History of Science”
(New York: Macmillan, 1917), ignores the most notable figures
among the author’s countrymen. A useful biographical directory
under the title of “American Men of Science” (New York
Science Press, 1910, 2d edition), has been compiled by Professor
James McKeen Cattell; a third revised edition has been prepared
and issued this year prior to the appearance of the present volume.</p>

<p>On the tendencies manifest in the United States there are several
important papers. An address by Henry A. Rowland entitled “A
Plea for Pure Science” (<cite>Popular Science Monthly</cite>, vol. LIX, 1901,
pp. 170–188), is still eminently worth reading. The external conditions
under which American scientists labour have been repeatedly
discussed in recent years in such journals as <cite>Science</cite> and <cite>School and
Society</cite>, both edited by Professor Cattell, who has himself appended
very important discussions to the above-cited biographical lexicon.
Against over-organization Professor William Morton Wheeler has
recently published a witty and vigorous protest (“The Organization
of Research,” <cite>Science</cite>, January 21, 1921, N. S. vol. LIII, pp.
53–67).</p>

<p>In order to give an understanding of the essence of scientific
activity the general reader cannot do better than to trace the processes
by which the master-minds of the past have brought order
into the chaos that is at first blush presented by the world of reality.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span>
In this respect the writings of the late Professor Ernst Mach are
unsurpassed, and even the least mathematically trained layman
can derive much insight from portions of his book “Die Mechanik”
(Leipzig, 7th edition, 1912), accessible in T. J. McCormack’s translation
under the title of “The Science of Mechanics” (Chicago:
Open Court Publishing Co.). The section on Galileo may be specially
recommended. Mach’s “Erkenntnis und Irrtum” (Leipzig,
1906) contains most suggestive discussions of the psychology of
investigation, dealing with such questions as the nature of a scientific
problem, of experimentation, of hypothetical assumptions, etc.
Much may also be learned from the general sections of P. Duhem’s
“La theorie physique, son objet et sa structure” (Paris, 1906).
E. Duclaux’s “Pasteur: Histoire d’un Esprit” has fortunately been
rendered accessible by Erwin F. Smith and Florence Hedges under
the title “Pasteur, the History of a Mind” (Philadelphia; Saunders,
1920). It reveals in masterly fashion the methods by which a great
thinker overcomes not only external opposition but the more baneful
obstacles of scientific folk-lore.</p>

<h3>PHILOSOPHY</h3>

<p>The omission of Mr. Santayana’s philosophy from the above account
indicates no lack of appreciation of its merits. Although
written at Harvard, it is hardly an American philosophy. On one
hand, Mr. Santayana is free from the mystical religious longings
that have given our Idealisms life, and on the other, he is too confident
of the reality of culture and the value of the contemplative
life to sanction that dominance of the practical which is the stronghold
of instrumentalism.</p>

<p>The only histories of American Philosophy are those by Professor
Woodbridge Riley. His “Early Schools” (Dodd, Mead &amp; Co.,
1907), is a full treatment of the period in question, but his “American
Thought from Puritanism to Pragmatism” (H. Holt, 1915) is
better reading and comes down to date. These are best read in connection
with some history of American Literature such as Barrett
Wendell’s “Literary History of America” (Scribner’s Sons, 1914).
Royce’s system is given in good condensed form in the last four
chapters of his “Spirit of Modern Philosophy” (Houghton Mifflin,
1899). Its exhaustive statement is “The World and the Individual”
(2 vols., Macmillan, 1900–1). The “Philosophy of Loyalty” (Macmillan,
1908) develops the ethics, and the “Problem of Christianity”
(2 vols., Macmillan, 1913), relates his philosophy to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span>
Christianity. Hocking’s religious philosophy is given in his “Meaning
of God in Human Experience” (Yale University Press, 1912).
His general position is developed on one side in “Human Nature and
Its Remaking” (Yale University Press, 1918). Anything of James
is good reading. His chief work is the “Principles of Psychology”
(H. Holt, 1890), but the “Talks to Teachers on Psychology and
Some of Life’s Ideals” (H. Holt, 1907) and the “Will to Believe”
(Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1899), better illustrate his attitude toward
life. “Pragmatism” (Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1907) introduces
his technical philosophizing. His religious attitude can be got
from the “Varieties of Religious Experience” (Longmans, Green
&amp; Co., 1902). Dewey has nowhere systematized his philosophy. Its
technical points are exhibited in the “Essays in Experimental Logic”
(University of Chicago Press, 1916). The “Influence of Darwin
on Philosophy” (H. Holt, 1910) has two especially readable essays,
one the title-essay, the other on “Intelligence and Morals.” The
full statement of his ethics is the “Ethics” (Dewey and Tufts, H.
Holt, 1908). He is at his best in “Education and Democracy”
(Macmillan, 1916). “German Philosophy and Politics” (H. Holt,
1915) is a war-time reaction giving an interesting point of view
as to the significance of German Philosophy. “The New Realism”
(Macmillan, 1912) is a volume of technical studies by the Six
Realists. “Creative Intelligence” (H. Holt, 1917), by John Dewey
and others, is a similar volume of pragmatic studies. The reviews
are also announcing another co-operative volume, “Essays in Critical
Realism” by Santayana, Lovejoy and others. In a technical fashion
Perry has discussed the “Present Tendencies in Philosophy” (Longmans,
Green &amp; Co., 1912), but the best critical reaction to American
philosophy is that of Santayana: “Character and Opinion in
the United States” (Scribner’s Sons, 1920). Santayana’s own chief
philosophic contributions are the “Sense of Beauty” (Scribner’s
Sons, 1896), and the “Life of Reason” (5 vols., Scribner’s
Sons, 1905–6). The first two chapters of his “Winds of Doctrine”
(Scribner’s Sons, 1913), on the “Intellectual Temper of the Age”
and “Modernism and Christianity,” are also relevant. Brief but
excellent expositions of Royce, Dewey, James, and Santayana by
Morris R. Cohen have appeared in the <cite>New Republic</cite>, vols. XX-XXIII.</p>

<h3>LITERATURE</h3>

<p>Perhaps the most illuminating books for any one interested in the
subject of the essay on literature are the private memorials of certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span>
modern European writers. For a sense of everything the American
literary life is <em>not</em>, one might read, for instance, the Letters of
Ibsen, Dostoievsky, Chekhov, Flaubert, Taine and Leopardi—all
of which have appeared, in whole or in part, in English.</p>

<p class="right">

</p>

<h3>MUSIC</h3>

<p>What little there is that is worth reading concerning American
music is scattered through magazine articles and chapters in books
upon other musical subjects. Daniel Gregory Mason has a sensible
and illuminating chapter, “Music in America,” in his “Contemporary
Composers.” The section, “America,” in Chapter XVI of the Stanford-Forsyth
“History of Music” contrives to be tactful and at
the same time just. Two books that should be read by any one
interested in native composition are Cecil Forsyth’s “Music and
Nationalism” and Lawrence Gilman’s “Edward MacDowell.”
Rupert Hughes’s “Contemporary American Composers” is twenty
years old, but still interesting; it contains sympathetic—not to say
glowing—accounts of the lives and works of an incredibly large
number of Americans who do and did pursue the art of musical
composition. To know what an artist means when he asks to be
understood read pages 240 and 241 of Cabell’s “Jurgen”—if you
can get it; also the volume, “La Foire sur la Place,” of “Jean
Christophe.”</p>

<h3>ART</h3>

<p>The reader may obtain most of the data on the history of American
art from Samuel Isham’s “History of American Painting,”
and Charles H. Caffin’s “Story of American Painting.” Very little
writing of an analytical nature has been devoted to American art,
and nearly all of it is devoid of a sense of perspective and of anything
approaching a realization of the position that American work
holds in relation to that of Europe. Outside of the writing that
is only incompetent, there are the books and articles by men whose
purpose is to “boost” the home product for nationalistic or commercial
reasons. In contrast with all this is Mr. Roger E. Fry’s
essay on Ryder, in the <cite>Burlington Magazine</cite> for April, 1908—a
masterful appreciation of the artist.</p>

<h3>THE THEATRE</h3>

<p>The bibliography of this subject is extensive, but in the main
unilluminating. It consists chiefly in a magnanimous waving aside
of what is, and an optimistic dream of what is to be. Into this
category fall most, if not all, of the many volumes written by the
college professors and such of their students as have, upon graduation,
carried with them into the world the college-professor manner
of looking at things. Nevertheless, Professor William Lyon Phelps’
“The Twentieth Century Theatre,” for all its deviations from fact,
and Professor Thomas H. Dickinson’s “The Case of American
Drama,” may be looked into by the more curious. Mr. Arthur
Ruhl’s “Second Nights,” with its penetrating humour, contains
several excellent pictures of certain phases of the native theatre.
Section IV of Mr. Walter Prichard Eaton’s “Plays and Players,”
Mr. George Bronson-Howard’s searching series of papers entitled,
“What’s Wrong with the Theatre,” and perhaps even Mr. George
Jean Nathan’s “The Popular Theatre,” “The Theatre, The Drama,
The Girls,” “Comedians All,” and “Mr. George Jean Nathan Presents”
may throw some light upon the subject. Miss Akins’
“Papa” and all of Mr. O’Neill’s plays are available in book form.
The bulk of inferior native dramaturgy is similarly available to the
curious-minded: there are hundreds of these lowly specimens on
view in the nearest book store.</p>

<h3>ECONOMIC OPINION</h3>

<p>The literature of economic opinion in America is almost as voluminous
as the printed word. It ranges from the ponderous treatises
of professed economists, wherein “economic laws” are printed in
italics, to the sophisticated novels of the self-elect, in which economic
opinion is a by-product of clever conversation. Not only can one
find economic opinion to his taste, but he can have it in any form
he likes. Perhaps the most human and reasonable application of the
philosophy of laissez-faire to the problems of industrial society is
to be found in the pages of W. G. Sumner. Of particular interest
are the essays contained in the volumes entitled “Earth Hunger,”
“The Challenge of Facts,” and “The Forgotten Man.” The most
subtle and articulate account of the economic order as an automatic,
self-regulating mechanism is J. B. Clark, “The Distribution of
Wealth.” An able and readable treatise, characterized alike by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span>
modified classical approach and by a recognition of the facts of
modern industrial society, is F. W. Taussig, “The Principles of
Economics.” The “case for capitalism” has never been set forth
as an articulate whole. The theoretical framework of the defence is
to be found in any of the older treatises upon economic theory. A
formal <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">apologia</i> is to be found in the last chapter of almost every
text upon economics under some such title as “A Critique of the
Existing Order,” “Wealth and Welfare,” or “Economic Progress.”
A defence of “what is,” whatever it may chance to be, characterized
alike by brilliancy and ignorance, is P. E. More’s “Aristocracy and
Justice.” Contemporary opinion favourable to capitalism may be
found, in any requisite quantity and detail, in <cite>The Wall Street
Journal</cite>, <cite>The Commercial and Financial Chronicle</cite>, and the publications
of the National Association of Manufacturers. <cite>The Congressional
Record</cite>, a veritable treasure house of economic fallacy, presents
fervent pleas both for an unqualified capitalism and for capitalism
with endless modifications. The literature of the economics
of “control” is beginning to be large. The essay by H. C. Adams,
“The Relation of the State to Industrial Activity,” elaborating the
thesis that the function of the state is to regulate “the plane of
competition,” has become a classic. The best account of the economic
opinion of organized labour is to be found in R. F. Hoxie, “Trade
Unionism in the United States.” Typical examples of excellent work
done by men who do not profess to be economists are W. Lippmann,
“Drift and Mastery,” the opinions (often dissenting) delivered by
Mr. Justice Holmes and Mr. Justice Brandeis, of the United States
Supreme Court, and the articles frequently contributed to periodicals
by T. R. Powell upon the constitutional aspects of economic questions.
The appearance of such studies as the brief for the shorter
working day in the case of <cite>Bunting v. Oregon</cite>, prepared by F. Frankfurter
and J. Goldmark, and of the “Report on the Steel Strike of
1919,” by the Commission of Inquiry of the Interchurch World
Movement indicates that we are beginning to base our opinions and
our policies upon “the facts.” Among significant contributions are
the articles appearing regularly in such periodicals as <cite>The New
Republic</cite> and <cite>The Nation</cite>. At last the newer economics of the
schools is beginning to assume the form of an articulate body of
doctrine. The books of T. B. Veblen, particularly “The Theory of
Business Enterprise,” and “The Instinct of Workmanship,” contain
valuable pioneer studies. In “Personal Competition” and in the
chapters upon “Valuation” in “Social Process,” C. H. Cooley has
shown how economic institutions are to be treated. The newer
economics, however, begins with the publication in 1913 of W. C.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">545</span>
Mitchell, “Business Cycles.” This substitutes an economics of
process for one of statics and successfully merges theoretical and
statistical inquiry. It marks the beginning of a new era in the
study of economics. The work in general economic theory has followed
the leads blazed by Veblen, Cooley, and Mitchell. W. H.
Hamilton, in “Current Economic Problems,” elaborates a theory of
the control of industrial development, interspersed with readings
from many authors. L. C. Marshal, in “Readings in Industrial
Society,” attempts, through selections drawn from many sources, an
appraisal of the institutions which together make up the economic
order. D. Friday, in “Profits, Wages, and Prices,” shows how much
meaning a few handfuls of figures contain and how much violence
they can do to established principles. The National Bureau of
Economic Research is soon to publish the results of a careful and
thorough statistical inquiry into the division of income in the United
States. Upon particular subjects such as trusts, tariffs, railroads,
labour unions, etc., the literature is far too large to be catalogued
here. There is no satisfactory history of economic opinion in the
United States. T. B. Veblen’s “The Place of Science in Modern
Civilization” contains a series of essays which constitute the most
convincing attack upon the classical system and which point the
way to an institutional economics. Many articles dealing with the
development of economic doctrines are to be found in the files of
<cite>The Quarterly Journal of Economics</cite> and of <cite>The Journal of Political
Economy</cite>. An excellent statement of the present situation in economics
is an unpublished essay by W. C. Mitchell, “The Promise of
Economic Science.”</p>

<h3>RADICALISM</h3>

<p>For exposition of the leading radical theories the reader is urged
to go, not to second-hand authorities, but to their foremost advocates.
“Capital” by Karl Marx (Charles H. Kerr) is of course the
chief basis of Socialism. There is nothing better on Anarchism than
the article in the “Encyclopedia Britannica” by Prince Kropotkin.
For revolutionary industrial unionism it is important to know
“Speeches and Editorials” by Daniel de Leon (New York Labor
News Co.). De Leon was one of the founders of the I.W.W.,
and his ideas not only influenced the separatist labour movements in
the United States but the shop-steward movement in England and
the Soviets of Russia. “Guild Socialism” by G. D. H. Cole is the
best statement of this recent theory, while “The State and Revolution”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">546</span>
by Nikolai Lenin (George Allen and Unwin) explains the
principles and tactics of modern Communism. To these should be
added another classic, “Progress and Poverty” by Henry George
(Doubleday Page).</p>

<p>On the origins of the American government it is important to
read “Economic Origins of Jeffersonian Democracy” and “Economic
Interpretation of the Constitution” by Charles A. Beard (Macmillan).</p>

<p>The “History of Trade Unionism” by Sidney and Beatrice Webb
(Longmans, Green), is an invaluable account of the growth of the
British labour movement, which has many similarities to our own.
“Industrial Democracy” by the same authors, issued by the same
publisher, is the best statement of the theories of trade unionism.
The “History of Labor in the United States” by John R. Commons
and associates (Macmillan), is a scholarly work, while “Trade
Unionism in the United States” by Robert F. Hoxie (Appleton), is
a more analytical treatment. “The I. W. W.” by Paul F. Brissenden
(Longmans, Green), is a full documentary history. Significant
recent tendencies are recorded in “The New Unionism in the Clothing
Industry” by Budish and Soule (Harcourt, Brace). The last
chapters of “The Great Steel Strike” by William Z. Foster (B. W.
Huebsch), expound his interesting interpretation of the trade unions.</p>

<p>For a statement of the functional attitude toward public problems
one should read “Authority, Liberty and Function” by Ramiro
de Maeztu (Geo. Allen and Unwin). For a brief and readable
application of this attitude to economics, “The Acquisitive Society”
by R. H. Tawney (Harcourt, Brace), is to be recommended.</p>

<p>“Modern Social Movements” by Savel Zimand (H. W. Wilson),
is an authoritative guidebook to present radical movements throughout
the world, and contains an excellent bibliography. And we
must not forget the voluminous Report of the New York State
Legislative Committee on Radicalism (the Lusk Committee), which
not only collects a wealth of current radical literature, but offers an
entertaining and instructive example of the current American attitude
toward such matters.</p>

<h3>HISTORY</h3>

<p>The late Henry Adams had much in common with Samuel Butler,
that other seeker after an education. He knew that he had
written a very good book (his studies on American history were
quite as excellent in their way as “Erewhon” was in a somewhat
different genre) and he was equally aware of the sad fact
that his work was not being read. In view of the general public
indifference towards history it is surprising how much excellent
work has been done. Three names suggest themselves when history
in America is mentioned, Robinson, Beard, and Breasted.
Their works for the elementary schools have not been surpassed in
any country and their histories (covering the entire period from
ancient Egypt down to the present time) will undoubtedly help to
overcome the old and firmly established prejudice that “history is
dull” and will help to create a new generation which shall prefer a
good biography or history to the literature of our current periodicals.</p>

<p>The group of essays published last year by Professor Robinson—the
pioneer of our modern historical world—under the title of
“The New History” contains several papers of a pleasantly suggestive
nature and we especially recommend “History for the Common
Man” for those who want to investigate the subject in greater
detail, and “The New Allies of History” for those who want to
get an idea of the struggle that goes on between the New and the
Old Movements in our contemporary historical world.</p>

<p>But it is impossible to suggest a three- four- or five-foot bookshelf
for those who desire to understand the issues of the battle that is
taking place. The warfare between the forces of the official School
and University History and those who have a vision of something
quite different is merely a part of the great social and economic and
spiritual struggle that has been going on ever since the days of
the Encyclopedists. The scene is changing constantly. The leaders
hardly know what is happening. The soldiers who do the actual
fighting are too busy with the work at hand to waste time upon
academic discussions of the Higher Strategy. And the public will
have to do what the public did during the great war—study the
reports from all sides (the relevant and the irrelevant—the news
from Helsingfors-by-way-of-Geneva and from Copenhagen-by-way-of
Constantinople) and use its own judgment as to the probable
outcome of the conflict.</p>

<h3>SEX</h3>

<p>As might be supposed, there has been little writing on sex in this
country—such discussion, more or less superficial, of the social
aspects as may be found in books on the family, on marriage or
prostitution, some quasi-medical treatises and of late a few books
along the lines of Freudian psychology, that is all. Among all the
organizations of the country there is no society corresponding to the
British Society for the Study of Sex. I doubt if such a society or
its publications would be tolerated, since even novelists who, like
Dreiser, express an interest in sex comparatively directly, run afoul
of public opinion, and a book such as “Women in Love” by D. H.
Lawrence, its publisher felt called upon to print without his name.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that in English the most adequate
discussions of sex have been made by an Englishman, Havelock Ellis—“Studies
in the Psychology of Sex.” Among less well known writing
on the subject by Ellis I would note in particular an illuminating
page or two in his essay on Casanova (“Affirmations”).</p>

<p>Discussion of the theories of distinguishing between mating and
parenthood and of crisis psychology may be found in articles by the
writer in the <cite>International Journal of Ethics</cite>, July, 1915, January,
1916, October, 1917, and in <cite>The American Anthropologist</cite>, March,
1916, and <cite>The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific
Methods</cite>, March, 1918.</p>

<p>“The Behaviour of Crowds” by E. D. Martin, and “French
Ways and Their Meaning” by Edith Wharton are recent books that
the reader of a comparative turn of mind will find of interest, and
if he is not already familiar with the writings of the Early Christian
Fathers I commend to him some browsing in the “Ante-Nicene
Christian Library” and the “Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers.”</p>

<h3>THE FAMILY</h3>

<p>For statistical facts which have a bearing on the tendencies of the
family in the United States, the following group of sources has been
consulted:</p>

<p>“Abstract of the Census, 1910;” the preliminary sheets of the
“Census of 1920;” Report on “Marriage and Divorce in 1916,”
published by the Bureau of the Census; Bulletin of the Woman’s
Bureau, U. S. Department of Labour on “What Became of Women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">549</span>
Who Went Into War Industries;” Bulletin of the U. S. Department
of Agriculture on “The Farm Woman;” Bulletin of the U. S. Children’s
Bureau on “Standards of Child Welfare.” Economic aspects
of the family and income data were acquired from “Conditions of
Labour in American Industries,” by Edgar Sydenstricker, and “The
Wealth and Income of the People of the United States,” by Willford
I. King. For facts concerning longevity, the aid of the Census was
supplemented by “The Trend of Longevity in the United States,”
by C. H. Forsyth, in the <cite>Journal of the American Statistical Association</cite>,
Vol. 128. For the long biological perspective to counteract the
near-sighted view of the Census, “The New Stone Age in Northern
Europe,” by John M. Tyler may be commended. Psychological
aspects of family relationships are discussed in a scientific and stimulating
way in the published “Proceedings of the International
Women Physicians’ Conference, 1919.”</p>

<h3>RACIAL MINORITIES</h3>

<p>No author or group of authors has yet attempted to treat in any
systematic and comprehensive way the position and the problem of
the several racial minorities in the United States. A perfect
bibliography of existing materials on the subject would be most
helpful, but it could not make good the existing shortage of fact,
and of thoughtful interpretation.</p>

<p>The anthropological phase of the subject is discussed with authority
by Franz Boas in “The Mind of Primitive Man” (Macmillan,
1913), and by Robert H. Lowie in “Culture and Ethnology”
(McMurtrie, 1917). Some information on racial inter-marriage is
to be found in Drachsler’s “Democracy and Assimilation—The
Blending of Immigrant Heritages in America” (Macmillan, 1920).
Among recent reports of psychological tests of race-difference, the
following are of special interest: “A Study of Race Differences in
New York City,” by Katherine Murdock, (<cite>School and Society</cite>,
vol. XI, no. 266, p. 147, 31 January, 1920); “Racial Differences in
Mental Fatigue,” by Thomas R. Garth (<cite>Journal of Applied
Psychology</cite>, vol. IV, nos. 2 and 3, p. 235, June-Sept. 1920); “A
Comparative Study in the Intelligence of White and Colored Children,”
by R. A. Schwegler and Edith Winn (<cite>Journal of Educational
Research</cite>, vol. II, no. 5, p. 838, December, 1920); “The Intelligence
of Negro Recruits,” by M. R. Trabue (<cite>Natural History</cite>, vol.
XIX, no. 6, p. 680, 1919); “The Intelligence of Negroes at Camp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">550</span>
Lee, Virginia,” by George Oscar Ferguson, Jr. (<cite>School and Society</cite>,
vol. IX, no. 233, p. 721, 14 June, 1919); and the Government’s
official report of all the psychological tests given in the cantonments
(“Memoirs of the National Academy of Science,” vol. XV, Washington,
Government Printing Office, 1921).</p>

<p>The most important single source of information on the present
status of the coloured race in the United States is “The Negro Year
Book,” edited by Monroe N. Work (Negro Year Book Pub. Co.,
Tuskegee Institute, Alabama); the edition for 1918–19 contains an
extensive bibliography. Brawley’s “Short History of the American
Negro” (Macmillan, rev. ed., 1919) presents in text-book form a
general narrative, together with supplementary chapters on such
topics as religion and education among the Negroes. The Government
report on “Negro Population, 1790–1915” (Washington,
Bureau of the Census, Government Printing Office, 1918), is invaluable.
Important recent developments are treated in “Negro
Migration in 1916–17” and “The Negro at Work During the World
War and During Reconstruction” (Washington, Dep’t of Labour,
1919 and 1920 respectively). Some notion of the various manifestations
of prejudice against the Negro may be gathered from the
following sources: “Negro Education” (<cite>U. S. Bureau of Education
Bulletin</cite>, 1916, nos. 38 and 39); “The White and the Colored
Schools of Virginia as Measured by the Ayres Index,” by George
Oscar Ferguson, Jr. (<cite>School and Society</cite>, vol. XII, no. 297, p. 170,
4 Sept., 1920); “Thirty Years of Lynching in the United States,
1889–1918,” and “Disfranchisement of Colored Americans in the
Presidential Election of 1920” (New York, National Association for
the Advancement of Coloured People, 1919 and 1921 respectively).
A few representative expressions from the Negroes themselves are:
“Up from Slavery, an Autobiography,” by Booker T. Washington
(Doubleday, 1901); “Darkwater,” by W. E. Burghardt Du Bois
(Harcourt, 1920); <cite>The Messenger</cite> (a Negro Socialist-syndicalist
magazine, 2305 Seventh Avenue, New York); and the “Universal
Negro Catechism” (Universal Negro Improvement Association, 56
West 135th Street, New York).</p>

<p>A great body of valuable information on the Indians is collected
in two publications of the Government, the second of which contains
a very extensive bibliography; “Indian Population in the United
States and Alaska, 1910” (Washington, Bureau of the Census,
Government Printing Office, 1915), and the “Handbook of American
Indians North of Mexico,” edited by Frederick Webb Hodge (Washington,
Bureau of Ethnology, Government Printing Office, 1907–10,
2 vols.). An annual report containing current data on the status of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">551</span>
the Indian is published by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.
Francis Ellington Leupp, who held this title from 1905 to 1909,
was the author of a volume which presents in popular form the
results of official experience (“The Indian and His Problem,”
Scribner, 1910).</p>

<p>The “American Jewish Year Book” (Philadelphia, Jewish Publication
Society of America) is an extremely useful volume, and particularly
so because one must refer to it for statistical information
which in the case of the other racial minorities is available in the
reports of the national census. In the <cite>American Magazine</cite> for April,
1921, Harry Schneiderman, the editor of the “Year Book,” assembles
a great many facts bearing upon the relation of the Jews to the
economic, social, political, and intellectual life of the country (“The
Jews of the United States,” p. 24). Of special interest to students
of the Semitic problem is Berkson’s “Theories of Americanization; a
Critical Study with Special Reference to the Jewish Group”
(Teachers’ College, Columbia University, 1920).</p>

<p>The standard works on the Oriental question are Coolidge’s
“Chinese Immigration” (Holt, 1909), and Millis’s “Japanese Problem
in the United States” (Macmillan, 1915). The Japanese problem
in California is treated statistically in a booklet prepared recently
by the State Board of Control (“California and the Oriental,”
Sacramento, State Printing Office, 1920), and in a symposium which
appeared in <cite>The Pacific Review</cite> for December, 1920 (Seattle, University
of Washington).</p>

<h3>ADVERTISING</h3>

<p>Expect from me no recommendation of the “scientific” treatises
on advertising or of the professional psychological analyses of the
instincts. Books, books in tons, have been written about advertising,
and as far as I am concerned, every single one of them is right.
Read these, if you have the hardihood, and remain mute. Read
them, I should say, and be eternally damned. Read them and
retire rapidly to a small room comfortably padded and securely
locked.</p>

<h3>BUSINESS</h3>

<p>Within the limits of this space anything like an adequate reference
to the source books of fact and thought is impossible. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">552</span>
that may be attempted is to suggest an arbitrary way through the
whole of the subject—a thoroughfare from which the reader may
take off where he will as his own interests develop. For the foundations
of an economic understanding one needs only to read “Principles
of Political Economy,” by Simon Newcomb, the American
astronomer, who in a mood of intellectual irritation inclined his
mind to this mundane matter and produced the finest book of its
kind in the world. For the rough physiognomy of American economic
phenomena there is “A Century of Population Growth,” Bureau of
the Census, 1909, a splendid document prepared under the direction
of S. N. D. North. Katharine Coman’s “Industrial History of the
United States” is an important work in itself and contains, besides,
an excellent and full bibliography. “Crises and Depressions” and
“Corporations and the State,” by Theodore E. Burton; “Forty
Years of American Finance,” by Alexander D. Noyes; “Railroad
Transportation, Its History and Its Laws,” by A. T. Hadley;
“Trusts, Pools and Corporations,” by Wm. Z. Ripley; and “The
Book of Wheat,” by Peter Tracy Dondlinger, are books in which
the separate phases indicated by title are essentially treated. For
dissertation, interpretation, and universal thought every student will
find himself deeply indebted to “Trade Morals, Their Origin, Growth
and Province,” by Edward D. Page; “The Economic Interpretation
of History,” by James E. Thorold Rogers; “History of the
New World Called America,” by E. J. Payne; “Economic Studies,”
by Walter Bagehot; “Essays in Finance,” by R. Giffen; “Recent
Economic Changes,” by David A. Wells, and “The Challenge of
Facts and Other Essays,” by William Graham Sumner.</p>

<h3>ENGINEERING</h3>

<p>Literature covering the function of the engineer in society, especially
in America, is very limited compared with books of information
on most subjects. Engineering activities such as are usually
described cover the technical achievements of the profession. Useful
material, however, will be found scattered throughout the technical
literature and engineering society proceedings especially among
the addresses and articles of leading engineers prepared for special
occasions. A comprehensive history of engineering has never been
written, although there are many treatises dealing with particular developments
in this field. Among these may be mentioned Bright’s
“Engineering Science, 1837–1897”; Matschoss’s “Beiträge zur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">553</span>
Geschichte der Technik und Industrie” (“Jahrbuch des Vereines
deutscher Ingenieure”); and Smiles’s “Lives of the Engineers.”
On engineering education, the “Proceedings of the Society for the
Promotion of Engineering Education” and Bulletin No. 11 of the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, “A Study
of Engineering Education,” by Charles R. Mann, offer useful information.
Concerning the status of the engineer in the economic
order, Taussig’s “Inventors and Money Makers,” Veblen’s “The
Engineers and the Price System,” together with Frank Watts’s “An
Introduction to the Psychological Factors of Industry,” will be
found of value. On the relation between labour and the engineer,
much can be found in <cite>The Annals of the American Academy of
Political and Social Science</cite> for September, 1920, on “Labor, Management
and Production.”</p>

<h3>SPORT AND PLAY</h3>

<p>Mr. Spalding, the well-known sporting goods manufacturer, is also
the publisher of the Spalding Athletic Library, which contains,
besides rule books and record books of various sports, a series of
text-books, at ten cents the copy, bearing such titles as “How to
Play the Outfield,” “How to Catch,” “How to Play Soccer,” “How
to Learn Golf,” etc. Authorship of these works is credited to
famous outfielders, catchers, soccer players, and golfers, but as the
latter can field, catch, play soccer, and golf much better than they
can write, the actual writing of the volumes was wisely left to
persons who make their living by the pen. The books are recommended,
as a cure for insomnia at least. The best sporting fiction
we know of, practically the only sporting fiction an adult may read
without fear of stomach trouble, is contained in the collected works
of the late Charles E. Van Loan.</p>
